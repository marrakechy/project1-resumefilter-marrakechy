"\n\nMan Threatens Explosion In Moscow \n\nThursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM\nMOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who\nsaid he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in\nfront of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV\ntelevision reported.\nThe officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man\ngot out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details\nwere immediately available.\nThe man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and\nITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to\ntalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nPolice and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within\nblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the\nman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news\nagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside\nthe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.\nThe man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove\nto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held\nfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The\nmove appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more\nsecure location. \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nThe Scotsman\n\n Thu 22 Aug 2002 \n\n Meaningful sentences \n \n Tracey Lawson \n \n \n If you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison\n history", as one judge described Charles Bronson, now’s your chance. Bronson -\n the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\n fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\n muscle power. \n \n Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\n has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\n has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\n day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\n virtually no cost. \n \n The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\n starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\n exercise industry. \n \n "I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it," is the\n opening paragraph penned by Bronson. "It’s a joke and a big con and they call\n me a criminal!" You can’t help feeling he has a point. \n \n This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\n already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\n created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\n discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure. \n \n Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\n when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison’s famous special unit, which aimed to\n help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n murder of "Babs" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n award-winning film. \n \n Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n a frank account of Glasgow’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n critical praise. \n \n And Lord Archer doesn’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\n deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\n scribbling away as we speak. \n \n So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson’s publisher, has published many books\n about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n pragmatic and profound. \n \n He says: "Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\n chance to focus on their creative skills. \n \n "It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\n education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\n anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents." \n \n However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n "Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n the very essence of who they are. \n \n "They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n good?" \n \n Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\n two days during a jail siege. \n \n Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\n and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: "I can hit\n a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds." \n \n But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\n Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson’s face sitting on every\n coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\n so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\n Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \n \n "All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it’s just a load of\n bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be\n described as a refreshingly honest style. "We can all be fat lazy bastards,\n it’s our choice, I’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\n your face with shit you become shit, that’s logical to me." \n \n As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\n we all needed. \n \n \n Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will\n be available in bookstores from October at £7.99\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

"\n\nSpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\nOwen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm\n\nInternet can level the political playing field\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\n\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one \nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, \nthe former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is \nfounder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written \nfor the Los Angeles Times. \n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"

But going on that very\nbroad assumption, I guess I\'m describing\nthe flip side of Mr. Roger\'s experience:\nthe paisanos (who leave behind those who\nremain on a patron\'s rural land) move to\nManila, and (the second assumption) squat\nin shantytowns there, at least until they\ncan line up a middle-class job.\n\nSo, going on two large assumptions, I can\ncome up with a scenario under which title\nwould take 20 years: a shantytown arises\nsomewhere in the midst of a section (or\nwhatever the Spanish used to divvy up the\nland) and it takes decades of arguing to\nput together a package which somehow can\nboth compensate the owner and record lots\nfor the inhabitants.  Just transferring\ntitle to an existing lot, between parties\nwho have money, ought not to be a problem.\n\nThe obvious solution, at least to us\nbarking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is\nto "introduce market mechanisms".

"\n\nHi everybody!\n\nI'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database \naccess with postgreSQL).\n\nThis will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a \nframework for other web applications.\n\nThe application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.\n\nI would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the \ndatabase, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.\n\nAbove all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.\n\nA problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for \nencryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \n\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.\n\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\n\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \nAfter all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to \nlearn methods and technics.\n\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\n\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \ndb connection/password to the main web application.\n\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \nbackground).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you,\nMario Torre\n-- \nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \n\n"

'\n\nFolks,\n \nmy first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.\n\n \nJust got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk\nfor Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went\nfine except it didn\'t pick up my monitor.\n \nI have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4\nTi4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse\'s default\nset. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.\nThen I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but\nit still doesn\'t feature my video card in the available list. What next?\n \nAnother problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,\nthe whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is\ninactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.\n \nIf anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I\'d be really grateful -\nI\'ve searched the \'net but have run out of ideas.\n \nOr should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?

Bush proclaimed, "The problem with\nthe French is that they don\'t have a word for entrepreneur."\n\nStatus:   False.\n\nOrigins:   Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain\'s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France\'s President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. "The problem with the\nFrench," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don\'t\nhave a word for entrepreneur."\n\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\n\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair\'s director of\ncommunications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"\nCampbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke."\n\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we\'ve\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush\'s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\n\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he\'s not the brightest fellow that\'s ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.\n\nBarbara "ears of corn" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated:   29 July 2002\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

Leave your current kernel as-is\n2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm\n3.

And kernel isn\'t an exception (although there are packages optimized\nfor various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules\nyou\'ll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)\n\nLast but not least : The kernel is something I\'m trying to keep away from\nin my packaging since I really don\'t want to see newbies screwing up their\nsystems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and\nother major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily\nuse my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release\nwithout having their system turned into another Ximian mess.\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: Yes Chris, I\'m worried about not giving you too much work!

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not\nsupport it, that\'s a serious problem with the business model; but that is\nnobody\'s problem but Habeas\'s.\n\nA possible solution is for Habeas\'s business model to include some kind of\nincentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet\nto think of an incentive that fits the bill ...\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:\n\n> I don\'t see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan\'s\n> points.\n> \n>   - high score: as far as I can see, that\'s because SpamAssassin is\n>     assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days, and the\n>     Habeas mark has to bring it down below that. :(   IMO we have to fix\n>     the high-scorers anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over 5 in our\n>     scoring system, 5 == tagged anyway.\n\nThis is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all\nits incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject\nat SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  \nIf some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,\nthere\'d better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their\nthresholds to 5.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:\n\n> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that\n> frequently hit on newsletters.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor\nof at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message\nbasis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:\n\n> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle\n> spam. It seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to\n> $1 or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for\n> copyright infringement.\n\nSorry, that just can\'t work.\n\nIf the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,\nand effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,\nSA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then\nspammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There\'s nobody\nleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their\nwill because their mail won\'t get through otherwise) to use the mark.\n\nConversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to\nmake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose\nfor which it was designed.\n\nEither way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against\nreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,\nthen either (a) they\'re out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights\nto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they\'ve both\ncreated and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" that\neverybody has to pay them for.\n\nThe latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do\nabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with\nlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly\nfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we\'ll be paying them for the\nprivilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don\'t believe they\'ll\never get that far, but I don\'t particularly want to help them make it.\n\n[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could \nconsist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n'

Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert\nWord 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &\npaste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only\nversion of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.\n\n> > I don\'t have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;\n> > I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some\n> > other more friendly format.\n\ni have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my\nsignificant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any\nlinux gui app that supports cdrecord\'s multi-session feature?)  since\nOpenOffice, i\'ve been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the\nsimple Word documents i receive from others).\n\nanyways...\n-- \n\nPLEASE REQUEST PERMISSION TO REDISTRIBUTE\n   AUTHOR\'S COMMENTS OR EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

"\n\nSeverity: Security\nProduct: gaim\nKeywords: gaim hyperlink manual\nReferences: \n  CAN-2002-0989 \n    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0989\n  Gaim Changelog\n    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog\n\nGaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC\nprotocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client\nthat combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the\nhyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an\nuntrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,\npermitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users\nmachine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the\nuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't\nvulnerable.\n\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser\ncommand to the shell.

However, the additional \ninformation won\'t be required.\n\nThe opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as \ncampaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the \nsame time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous \npolitical spam.\n\nTarget Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had \nasked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring \nfinancial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would \nuse up too much of the 160 character-maximum.\n\nPolitical messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from \nthe financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless\' petition was \nsupported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular \nTelecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade \ngroups.\n\nFEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the \ncommission\'s policy not to meddle with new technology that has the \npotential to reach more voters.\n\n"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before \neveryone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.\n\nOpponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or \nallow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political \nmessages while remaining anonymous.\n\nBiersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.\n\nTarget Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as \n"good for America."\n\n"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running \nfor office," he said.

'\n\n\nXviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a\ncompany  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,\ndivx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very\ngpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to\nput preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.\n\nSome notes from other places....\n\n>>From Doom9 [3]\n"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4\nVideo Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.\nSoon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers\nhave contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those\nwho don\'t know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -\nwhich demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it\nunder the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma\ncodec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen\ncode, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only\ndisguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once\nagain contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today\nnothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public\nin the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince\nSigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has\nbeen resolved XviD development will not continue.\n\nThat being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about\nthe Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.\nInternally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors\nfirst wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes\nand kept quiet about the matter at hand.\n\n[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of\nthe source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it\'s already up for download.\nHowever, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release\nmakes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we\nmight be hearing more about this.\n\n[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it\nalso looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD\ndoesn\'t get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides\nwith Sigma\'s Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before\ndownloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they\'d\nfully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn\'s relationship with\nSigma didn\'t really work out either, as Sigma\'s Xcard is not as DivX\ncompatible as it was advertised.\n\n[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma\nsource code does not mean it\'s all over, it\'s far from being over. The\nlicense agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and\ninstall the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now\nclearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)\nthat the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the\ncopyright notices of the original developers have been removed and\nreplaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you\ncan\'t just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright\nstatements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on\nyour own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken\nfrom the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different\ncopyright notices which is quite funny."\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.xvid.org/\n[2] http://www.sigmadesigns.com\n[3] http://www.doom9.org/\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

'\n\nfrom http://www.arstechnica.com/\n\n"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department\nof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against\nindividuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted\nmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\nthat "criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\npreserve the viability of America\'s content industries." Malcolm also\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\ncopyrighted works.\n\n\n"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\nprosecution," said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\nconference panel.\n\nI\'m not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\ninitiate because of the "schooling" effect of millions of systems\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\nthe crowd.\n\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\n\n\nCriminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\nwillful infringement.\n...\nThe term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\n\n\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as "financial gain"\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\n\nThe statute of limitations:\n\n\n507. Limitations on actions\n\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\nyears after the cause of action arose.\n\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\nthe claim accrued.\n\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\n\nI\'m still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\nprosecute because of the aforementioned "schooling" effect, but my guess\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to\nbe crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit\n_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter\nas much in the embedded world.\n\nAnd in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec\n[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.\n\n> The real issue is compiler availability.

When\nthe new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will\nbe offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.\n\nILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a\ntraining class for staff at the UCC computer science department.\nBrelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the\nLinux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish\nuniversities.\n\nThe user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme\nthat aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source\nstyle of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational\nchannel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software\nwith its operating environment and offering networked support\nservices to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed\nto suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to\nschools and universities throughout the world.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance\nfeatures and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to\nmaster on personal systems.\n\nThe Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red\nHat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial\nservices for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now\nits involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,\nalthough it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in\nEurope that offer consulting or technical support services.\n\nDavid Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,\nsees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take\na more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his\noffice in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish\ncompanies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced\nsome to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.\n\n\n-------------\nMany thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.\n\nRegards\nL.\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"

"\n\nHere's a weird and wacky problem:\n\nI'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop.

With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.\nBut there was something else. What would later come to be called South\nAmerica and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the\neast coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast\n-- which no European was known to have seen.\nThe ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of\nmodern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right\ngeographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed\nalong its top.\nThe shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the\ncurvature of the Earth.\nIt is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12\nlarge printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was\npublished six years before Vasco Balboa\'s 1513 trip across the Isthmus of\nPanama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan\'s 1519-22 trip around the\nworld.\nDid someone get there earlier?\n...\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the\ndoormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.\n\nTimC\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\n>>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk\n\n Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK \n\n Fake bank website cons victims\n \n West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank\'s online\n service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze\n more money out of people they had already hooked. \n \n The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,\n (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being\n taken in by the fake website. \n \n The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a\n share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African\n nations. \n \n NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would\n otherwise spot the scam. \n \n Convincing site \n \n News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an\n unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out\n their victims. \n\n A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in\n front of the bank\'s name. \n \n "I have seen the microsite myself and it\'s very sophisticated," said the NCIS\n spokesman. "It\'s very convincing especially to people not very experienced\n online." \n \n Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people\n behind it have not been caught. \n \n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \n \n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \n\n Domain games \n \n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \n \n The \'419\' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\n crimes. \n \n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \n \n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\n it. \n \n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \n \n Cutting edge fraud \n \n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\n legitimacy. \n \n \n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\n \n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\n place of the certificates. \n \n "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\n technology," said the spokesman. \n \n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\n Reserve Bank, the country\'s national bank. \n \n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\n been deposited in their name. \n \n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \n \n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \n \n Modern gloss \n \n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\n old cons a modern gloss. \n \n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \n \n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\n true, undoubtedly is. \n \n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\n service Paypal. \n \n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \n \n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen\'s personal use. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.html\n\nEvangelicals\' threat to new archbishop\n\nDirect action threat over liberal views on sexuality\n\nStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent\nTuesday October 8, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust\nRowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes\nup his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him.\nThe council of the Church Society, the Church of England\'s oldest\nevangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,\nwhich is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his\nsupposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.\nFollowing an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met\nthe archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his\nappointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.\nThe move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to\ndestabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded\nwith deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.\nSome evangelicals object to Dr Williams\'s acknowledgement that he has\nordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who\nhave sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new\narchbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the\nchurch.\nNevertheless, the society said: "It is clear that he prefers his private\njudgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the\ncommon mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.\n"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan\nWilliams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand\ndown," it said.\nThe society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling on\nbishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of\nwhich archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from\nDr Williams\'s doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be\n"taking steps towards appropriate direct action".\nIt added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal\ncalled Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles\nallegedly commending homosexual behaviour.\nDespite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the\nchurch. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown\nappointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his\nappointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.\nHe is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be\nformally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.\nAsked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the\nsociety\'s chairman, said: "Watch this space." Presumably it could involve a\nsmall minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking\nalternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams\nis present.\nChurch of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down\nduring the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the\nevangelical extremists\' challenge, which appears to have grown in the\nabsence of a robust rebuttal.\nA letter by senior theologians in today\'s Guardian, however, repudiates the\nevangelicals\' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical\nteaching.\nOn the BBC\'s Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of\nWestcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams\'s opponents of presumption\nand blackmail. "It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is\nattempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get\nyour way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said.\nLast week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. "Matters of sexuality\nshould not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church\nSociety have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his\nappointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take\nthe post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God."\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.html\n\nWeevil pest warms to life in south-west London\n\nJames Meek, science correspondent\nTuesday October 8, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nThey\'re chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy\ntaste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they\nare vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.\nTwo species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain\'s cold\nwinters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been\ndetected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.\n"This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," said\nMax Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London\nwho discovered the creatures in the UK.\nThe black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous\ndamage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It\'s very likely\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\nplants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they\'re here to stay."\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\' successful colonisation of\nBritain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a\nfact.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

"\n\nNobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work \n\nTuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM\nSTOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in\nphysics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in\nnature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.\nRiccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,\nD.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering\ncontributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic\nX-ray sources.''\nRaymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other\nhalf of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the\nUniversity of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant\nunderground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from\nthe sun by the billion.\nNeutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because\nthey are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.\nIn fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South\nDakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.\nKoshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino\ndetector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and\nalso discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of\nthe brightest objects in the universe.\nThe Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for\nbuilding the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and\nsharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.\nHis research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the\ndiscovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the\nhearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.\nWhen academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside\nWashington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba\nalso was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach\nDavis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.\nThis year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney\nBrenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,\n55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the\nKarolinska Institute.\nThe researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ\ngrowth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how\nviruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as\nAIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.\nThe winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday\nmorning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of\nAlfred Nobel later the same day.\nThe literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish\nAcademy said on Tuesday.\nThe winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -\nwill be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.\nThe award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are\nnot publicly revealed for 50 years.\nAlfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who\nendowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.\nIn his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to\nthose who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and\n``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field\nof physics.''\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and\neconomics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts\nin the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted\nin strict secrecy.\nThe prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in\n1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.\n---\nOn the Net:\nNobel site, http://www.nobel.se \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nAnanova:\xa0 \nDracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest\n\nA controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be\nswitched away from Transylvania.\nConsultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in\nBucharest instead.\nIt comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the\noriginal proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider\nin the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the\nproject.\nBut that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the\ninspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost\nthe local economy.\nEvenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with\nthe Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.\nDorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: "The pre-feasibility report from\nPWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in\nBucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."\nThe park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost\ntrain and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a\nreconstruction of Dracula\'s castle and an artificial lake.\nThe project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation\nUnesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on\nOctober 15.\nStory filed: 13:16 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nAnanova:\xa0 \nNewspaper\'s readers complain over \'let\'s have sex\' picture caption\n\nReaders of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption\nabout jewellery contained the words "let\'s have sex".\nThe mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages\nspoken in Namibia.\nCallers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which\ntranslates roughly as "let\'s have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.\nIt was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from\nthe femidon - female condom - as jewellery.\nAccording to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV\npatients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.\nHe intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.\nOne caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people\'s\nlanguages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And\nthat the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".\nOthers indicated that various words might have different meanings in various\nNamibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in\nSiyeyi means testicles.\nAnother word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo\ntranslates as let\'s talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let\'s have\nintercourse.\nThe Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.\nStory filed: 12:37 Tuesday 8th October 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I think that decentralization is the workaround\nfrom technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way\ninconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by \nprotecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. \nThe local information when combined with the technical\ntroubles of providing "just enough" forced synchronization\nto remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.\nenforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when\nconcerns are more immedidate.  \n\nTolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how\npeople cope, otherwise you\'d be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily\npre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee\'s neck\nwho thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the\nwhole world would be a little more perfect and everything,\nincluding his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently\nbe in its proper place.\n\nGreg\n\n\n'

The freight still isn\'t moving,\nfactories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and\nretailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing\nday. \n\nOn Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to \nsee how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this \nisn\'t a difficult question, as the panel\'s been given all of one \nday to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the\nnext step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the\n1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work\nfor 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the\ndisputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.\n\nInvoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or\nsafety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao\ncovered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work\nstoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew \nIraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly\nresponded that their members have been unloading military cargo\nthroughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an\nanonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion \nof what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."\n\nPolitically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley\nwould annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the\nother hand, "Voter discontent with Bush\'s handling of the\nincreasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in\npolls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political\ndanger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco \nChronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll\nreported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the \neconomy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased\nexamination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his\nmind that it was hurting national security and the economy,\nandmerited federal intervention," said the AP. \n\nAs for Taft-Hartley, it\'s not exactly famous for solving labor\ndisputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers\nsimply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).\nOne gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers\'\ncontract isn\'t the point of this particular 80 days. It\'s 78\ndays until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer\n\nPresident Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle\nTimes)\nhttp://tinyurl.com/1usn\n\nBush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis \nhttp://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html\n\nPresident Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast\nPorts\nhttp://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story\n\n\nBush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port\nTalks Break Off (AP)\nhttp://tinyurl.com/1usk\n\nWhite House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times)\nhttp://tinyurl.com/1usm\n\nCooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle)\nhttp://tinyurl.com/1usp\n\nBush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.html\n\nTrouble On The Docks\nhttp://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html\n(Paid subscription required.)\n\nCharges of Politics Have Dogged Taft-Hartley Act\nhttp://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/90243_hartley08.shtml\n\nTaft-Hartley Act No Quick-Fix For Port Dispute (Reuters)\nhttp://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2002/10/02/rtr739458.html\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nADVERTISEMENT\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSPECIAL OFFER!

The two dominant direct broadcast satellite\nplayers want to join forces, the better to compete with Big\nCable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice\nDepartment, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of\nDirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite \nservice in the US.\n\nThe press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed\nmerger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- \nit was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and\n$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as \nsome outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,\nand others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV\nand EchoStar is Dish. All straight?\n\nThe two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold\noff ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice\nDepartment has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified\n"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with\nJustice in the next weeks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those\nrevisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies\nto Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted \nto get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the \ncable company\'s plans and past spending on such a project.\n\nTheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for\ninvestors in the satellite space. It seems the market for\nexpanded-service television may be nearing saturation.\nTheStreet.com quoted an analyst\'s report which concluded,\n"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but\nshareholders may realize much smaller returns."\n\nThe New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch \nwaiting in the wings.

The freight still isn\'t moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. </P><P>\nOn Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn\'t a difficult question, as the panel\'s been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax\ndosages.</P><P>\nInvoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion of\nwhat the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."</P><P>\nPolitically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush\'s handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the\neconomy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. </P><P>\nAs for Taft-Hartley, it\'s not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers\' contract isn\'t the point of this particular 80 days. It\'s 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>\nPresident Acts To Halt Port Lockout for 80 Days (Seattle Times)<br>\n<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/1usn">http://tinyurl.com/1usn</A> </P><P>\nBush Expected To Act on Ports Crisis <br>\n<A HREF="http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html">http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/business/1002/08ports.html</A> </P><P>\nPresident Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast Ports<br>\n<A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story">http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ports8oct08001439,0,1021983.story</A> </P><P>\nBush Takes Step Toward Halting Lockout After West Coast Port Talks Break Off (AP)<br>\n<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/1usk">http://tinyurl.com/1usk</A> </P><P>\nWhite House Intervenes on Docks Dispute (Financial Times)<br>\n<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/1usm">http://tinyurl.com/1usm</A> </P><P>\nCooling-off Period Likely in Port Fight (SF Chronicle)<br>\n<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/1usp">http://tinyurl.com/1usp</A> </P><P>\nBush Moves Toward Halting Port Shutdown<br>\n<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/national/08PORT.html</A> </P><P>\nTrouble On The Docks<br>\n<A HREF="http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html">http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0864,00.html</A> <br>\n(Paid subscription required.)</P><P>\nCharges of Politics Have Dogged Taft-Hartley Act<br>\n<A HREF="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/90243_hartley08.shtml">http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/90243_hartley08.shtml</A> </P><P>\nTaft-Hartley Act No Quick-Fix For Port Dispute (Reuters)<br>\n<A HREF="http://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2002/10/02/rtr739458.html">http://www.forbes.com/work/newswire/2002/10/02/rtr739458.html</A> <br>\n</P>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</font>\n\t\t</td></tr> \n\t\t\n\t\n\t</table>\n\t\n\t</td></tr></table> \n\n\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<!-- 2,6:article_view -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n<font face="verdana,arial" size="2"><FONT face=Verdana size=1><STRONG>Sponsor</STRONG></FONT></font>\n<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" bgcolor="#000000"> \n<tr><td>\n<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">\n\n<tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFCC">\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t<TABLE bgcolor="#FFFFCC" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t<tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><td>\n\t<a name="a75853"></a> \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<font face="verdana,arial" size="2">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<P>SPECIAL OFFER!

We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.</P><P>\nThe press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?</P><P>\nThe two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified "major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks.</P><P>\nThe Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company\'s plans and past spending on such a project.</P><P>\nTheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst\'s report which concluded, "Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."</P><P>\nThe New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch\'s News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar.

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\n\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \n\nJay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\n\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\n\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\n\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\n\n\n\n********************************************************************\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

"\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.html\n\nBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe\n\nJohn Carvel, social affairs editor\nWednesday August 28, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According\nto the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,\nshoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.\nThe figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of\nanthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the\nUniversity of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit\npeople's shape.\nThe volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the\ninner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below\nthe buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.\nIt has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)\ntaller than his French counterpart.\nThe mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men\nonly the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height\nadvantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.\nThe average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared\nwith 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and\n1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and\nAmericans 1,626.7mm\nMore disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other\nnationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men\nand 66.7 for women.\nThe average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7\ninches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and\n806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of\n1,047.2mm.\nThe average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second\nlargest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably\nsmaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.\nThe average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than\nthe French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the\nSwedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively\noutstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.\nHowever Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm\ncompared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,\ncompared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.\nThe DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the\navailable evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm\nlonger than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American\naverage.\nThe British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German\ncounterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.\nBeverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for\noccupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.\nThe department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to\nopen ring pull cans.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nThe Electronic Telegraph\n\n Emigrate to Russia? That\'s a steppe too far\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \n \n \n So you think you\'ve got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\n or sick of Sheffield.\n \n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\n \n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\n with life in Blair\'s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\n \n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\n side.\n \n "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said Kommersant.\n \n "In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\n becoming \'traditionally\' relaxed."\n \n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\n \n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\n opening time in the nation\'s vodka shops.\n \n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\n "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\n life.\n \n "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\n of whisky for kopecks."\n \n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\n halfpenny in sterling.\n \n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\n diehard alcoholics.\n \n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\n \n "For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\n off the tails from the entire collective farm\'s herd of cattle."\n \n One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\n Mongolian border.\n \n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\n which they would like to live.\n \n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country "where English is only known\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".\n \n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\n \n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\n \n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\n climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will\n solve itself".\n \n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\n \n "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\n amongst our citizens."\n \n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\n preferred new home.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

"\n\nThe Electronic Telegraph\n\n Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected \n By Bruce Johnston in Rome\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \n \n \n Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's\n traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six\n people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.\n \n \n Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena \n Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio\n nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,\n contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.\n \n Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take\n part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the\n off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.\n \n Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\n \n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\n \n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\n \n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\n from video footage.\n \n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\n that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.\n \n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\n the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\n \n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not\n grab their reins.\n \n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\n Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\n \n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html\n\nHamza\'s horrid - but we must tolerate him\n\nRod Liddle\nWednesday August 28, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nSheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman\nto scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing\nwith his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.\nI\'ve often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on\nstatutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the\nway home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the\nsea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,\nand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen\nfor once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and\nmaybe me and you, too.\nBut B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza\'s budget since the\nBank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded\nhappy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic\nproto-warriors in the background.\nYou must know Hamza; he\'s the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily\nMail\'s cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye\ncovered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don\'t\nmock the disabled any more these days, unless it\'s someone like Hamza whom\nwe don\'t like; then, if you\'ll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come\noff. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the\nBritish right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for his\narrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe\noff to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and\nthus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if\nwe can\'t lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him\nto shut up.\nBecause we don\'t like Hamza very much. We weren\'t that fond of him before\nSeptember 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all\nthought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political\npersecution.\nAnd now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they\'ve\ngot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory\nmanner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of\ncontext, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But\nperhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and\ntolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror\'s\nscoop.\nHamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier\nthis year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his\nallegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn\'t know Charity Commissioners were\nmeant to do stuff like that.\nHe has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been\nfrozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the\nmedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations\nand the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly\n- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be\ntrue - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if British\nMuslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could\nturn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.\nThe trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was\nrevealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of those\ngovernment-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -\ndragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism\nand a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.\nAn opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4\'s Today programme revealed that an\noverwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush\'s crusade.\nOne in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US\n(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought\nthe war against terrorism was a war against Islam.\nWhich is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the\ntime, we didn\'t want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at\nhome and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from\nthe liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US\nforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action\nagainst Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.\nNor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don\'t\nsuppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday\'s Guardian,\nthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful\nfor the sheikh\'s message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.\nWhich is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has\nbeen wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more\ninflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His\nideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be\nhappy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for\nexample. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly\nrepellent.\nAnd that\'s the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire\nto be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful\nappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the\nruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.\nMulticulturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that\nare antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.\nThe FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing\nremotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution\nis simply the pungency of his views.\nIt is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his\nrhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This\nis a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.\nYou don\'t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn\'t exist. And\nif British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of\nunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is\nnot because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man\nup, therefore, won\'t make a difference.\nIt is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:\nThe glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.\nBut if you break the bloody glass, you won\'t hold up the weather.\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722\n\nPro-hunt activists target top sight\n\nONE of Yorkshire\'s most famous sights yesterday became one of the first\ntargets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting\ndebate.\nVillagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday\nto find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the\nnight.\nIn another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman\nand three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent\na Celtic god or tribal symbol.\nPro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) \xad a radical\nalternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance \xad admitted\nresponsibility last night for targeting the two images.\nThe 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it\nwas carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in\n1857.\nBut during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman\nwith a horn \xad which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white\ncarpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse\nAssociation, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.\nJohn Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well\norganised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a\nhorn cut out of carpets.\n"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it\nto bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings\nto be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will\nnot get another refit for another year.\n"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle \xad a tractor and trailer or a\nlorry \xad because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely\nwell planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."\nThe sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south\nof England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs\nwhitening.\nMr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the\ndeterioration, which means it will need more work next time.\n"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to\ntake it away again because it was a major job."\nAndy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:\n"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud\nof it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful\nconsideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of\nvegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There\nhas not been a cut in the turf \xad which would be much more of a problem. It\nwould seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."\nAn RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very\nfrustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches\ndon\'t seem to be doing anything good."\nThe Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.\nSpokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates\ncampaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and\nregrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."\nThe incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in\nYorkshire thought to be RCA work.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

"\n\nThe Times\n\n August 28, 2002\n \n It's August, and big cats are on the prowl\n By Alan Hamilton\n \n \n \n ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \n \n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \n \n “During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\n the public has been fantastic,” Mr Bamping said. “Big cats in Britain are\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; there’s more of them.” \n \n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\n Fraser, who heads the society’s Scottish arm, said: “Lynx are now present in\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don’t\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.” \n \n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \n \n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \n \n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \n \n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\n \n \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as\n(a) I don\'t put Orville\'s name on the headstock and (b) I license the\npatented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar\non eBay with "Gibson" written in crayon on the headstock, and then\nclaim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get\nupset.\n\n    M> Why is it that people don\'t understand that giving stuff away\n    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  \n\nTo play the Devil\'s Advocate here, it\'s not about giving /stuff/ away,\nit is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution\nrights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn\'t\nstop you from making 10000 copies to sell.\n\n    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  \n\nThis is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?\nThe "other stuff" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.\nThis is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it\'s no harder\nto dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents\npeople from doing it?\n\nPersonally, I don\'t think the issue should have anything to do with\nsales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit\nshould be able to "own" someone else\'s intellectual property.  Sarah\nMcLaughlin isn\'t suing you, it\'s her label\'s legal dept because it\'s\nthe label who stands to lose; Sarah\'s already fat beyond her wildest\ndreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up\ntomorrow, it\'s not going to really traumatize her (unless she\'s been\nblazingly stupid with her money)\n\nBut the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so\nthey can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.\nIf you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems\nwith beautiful-people deadbeat leech "friends" draining their riches,\nthink again.\n\nThe problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we\nmake the semantic flip, it\'s unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,\nall it takes is looking at the same situation in a different\nway.  Here\'s the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.\n\nElvis didn\'t make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did\nthe work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving\nmilk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/\nlabour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley\'s pills.  All\nElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or\ncollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as\nsomething of their own.  But it\'s not _Elvis_ who made them universal\nstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into\ntheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.\n\nTherefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay\nbefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties\nfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for\na beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over\nagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer\'s song /their/\nfavourite song????  That\'s where the whole system has been seriously\nwarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your\nthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It\'s not.  It\'s\nthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\n"Computers are useless.

'\n\nNo analysis yet... don\'t know what to make of it yet. But here\'s the raw \nbits for all to peruse and check out what\'s really going on... Best, \nRohit\n\n===========================================================\n\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\nBy\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\'s device processes the data in \nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \naccording to company officials.\n\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \ndata.\n\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \nbusinesses.\n\n"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. \n"The XA35 is the first of a family."\n\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \nalternative.\n\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \nimportance in the world of XML.\n\n"Today\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly \nsaid. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \nFirewalls are blind to XML today."\n\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n\n"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, \nadding that to his knowledge no other company\'s solution does. Kelly \nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \nwill be mostly false.\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \nas they pass through the device.\n\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \ncontrols the device.\n\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \ndesigned the industry\'s first solutions to address the unique \nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\n\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\'s team raised the bar \nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \n2001, DataPower\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \nindustry\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\'s first wire-speed XML \nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of \nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \nindustry-leading customers and partners.\n\nDataPower\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, \ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer \nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of \nDirectors.\n\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and \nsales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. \nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML \nnetworking\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions \nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on \nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.\n\n"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \nDataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \napplications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \nTechnology.\n\n"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web \nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single \nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \nservers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\n\n"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses \na very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael \nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with \nDataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \nperformance and security pitfalls."\n\n"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly \ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \nsecurity," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on \ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \nGeneration Three (XG3)\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date."\n\n"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \nservices," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPower’s \nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely \non XML for mission critical applications."\n\nAbout Venrock Associates\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \nthat now spans over seven decades.

But here\'s the raw\n\nbits for all to peruse and check out what\'s really going on... Best, \nRohit\n\n===========================================================\n\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\nBy\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\'s device processes the data in \nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \naccording to company officials.\n\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\n\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\n\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \ndata.\n\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \nbusinesses.\n\n"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. \n"The XA35 is the first of a family."\n\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\n\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \nalternative.\n\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \nimportance in the world of XML.\n\n"Today\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly \nsaid. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \nFirewalls are blind to XML today."\n\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\n\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n\n"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, \nadding that to his knowledge no other company\'s solution does. Kelly \nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \nwill be mostly false.\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\n\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\n\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\n\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \nas they pass through the device.\n\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\n\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \ncontrols the device.\n\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in\n\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\n\n========================================================================\n=\n\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \ndesigned the industry\'s first solutions to address the unique \nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\n\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\'s team raised the bar \nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \n2001, DataPower\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \nindustry\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\'s first wire-speed XML \nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of\n\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \nindustry-leading customers and partners.\n\nDataPower\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,\n\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n\n========================================================================\n=\n\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer\n\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of \nDirectors.\n\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and\n\nsales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.\n\nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML \nnetworking\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions\n\nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on \nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.\n\n"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \nDataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \napplications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \nTechnology.\n\n"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web\n\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single\n\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \nservers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\n\n"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses \na very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael \nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with \nDataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \nperformance and security pitfalls."\n\n"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly\n\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \nsecurity," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on\n\ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \nGeneration Three (XG3)\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date."\n\n"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \nservices," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPower’s \nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely\n\non XML for mission critical applications."\n\nAbout Venrock Associates\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \nthat now spans over seven decades.

(remembering to never ever ever power\nup your system without a heatsink & fan).\n\nIf after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,\nfrom it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and\nno actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you\nhave power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.\n\nOnce you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually\ndisjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.\nPower On Self Test.\n\nBod\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"

'\n\nHi all,\n\nI\'ve decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is\nthat I\'ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually\ntesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality\npeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from\nthat, right? ;-)\n\nI\'ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages\nshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and\nmaybe others, who knows ;-)\n\nHere are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :\n- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel\n  (you can install the binary package if you\'re using the i686 2.4.18-10)\n- Install this "alsa-driver" package\n- Install the "alsa-libs" package\n- Install the "alsa-utils" package\n\nNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your\n/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/\n(very complete and very good documentation!)\nHopefully you\'ll see that your card *is* supported ;-)\n\nReboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you\'ll probably need\nto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and\ninsert the new ones. If all is well you\'ve got ALSA working!

'\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html\n\nLIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina\'s parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru\'s Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. \n\nJust over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. \n\nAged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. \n\nAt the time, Peru\'s government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as "Little Chicago." \n\nNow 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. \n\nBut a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina\'s story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. \n\n"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care," Jose Sandoval, author of "Mother Aged 5," told Reuters. \n\n"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That\'s my fundamental objective," he added. \n\n\'Totally willing to help\'\nSandoval has raised Medina\'s case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. \n\n"We\'re totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp\'s office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. \n\nMedina\'s husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. "She got no help (in 1939) that I know about," he said. "She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true." \n\nJurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters\' request for an interview. \n\nMedical rarity\nNo one has ever established who was the father of Medina\'s child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. \n\nOne of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru\'s poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. \n\nHe said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. \n\nHer swelling stomach worried her parents. "They thought it was a tumor," he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. \n\nThere came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. \n\nHer father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. \n\nSandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. \n\nMore offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother\'s Day. \n\nOne offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World\'s Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. \n\nBut within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. \n\nBut Sandoval said: "It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them." \n\nHappy ending?\nThough physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. \n\nMedina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. \n\nAfter taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. \n\nHe died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body\'s bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. \n\nMedina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. \n\nShe appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "We just want to get on with our lives, that\'s it," said Jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world\'s youngest mother. \n\nHe said the couple\'s main concern now, if the government\'s offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. \n\nHe said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves\' paradise. \n\n"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property," he said. \n\nAs for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina\'s story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "I believe there will be a happy ending," he said. \n\n"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era\nof corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the\ncountry will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the\nprejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands\nand the Republic is destroyed."\nAbraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col.

A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.\n\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe\'s cybercrime treaty \n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.\n\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden \nelectronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\n\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries\' police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \nor ratified, the treaty.\n\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\n\n"It seems to me that the main justification they\'ve given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes," Geist said. "To me that\'s not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case."\n\nGeist added that "there\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don\'t know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems."\n\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\n\n"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\n\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data." EPIC opposes \n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\n\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \nof Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with \npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The \nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information," \nthe draft says.\n\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea."\n\n"Immediately you have to wonder if you\'re allowed to use anonymous \nmobile phones or whether you\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \nanonymously," Hosein said.\n\nA representative for George Radwanski \n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\'s privacy commissioner, said \nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on \nthe paper as it stands."\n\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\n\n\n\n\n'

Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced\nthe object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home\nin Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.\nBut while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied\nacademic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl\nis adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.\nSiobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation \xad that the\nodd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.\nBut on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed \xad because\nit was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.\n"I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble\nsurface," she said.\nAfter closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on\nthe Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check\nthe object for authenticity.\nIf it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for\nauction.\nShe added: "If it isn\'t worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself\nfor sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."\nBut Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of\nacademic caution.\n"Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece\nof extraterrestrial rock," he said.\n"They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions\nand cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt\naround the edge.\n"Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the\nsmallest that they usually appear."\nTo establish the provenance of Siobhan\'s suspected meteorite it would have\nto be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it\nbeing extra-terrestrial are slim.\n"Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth\'s surface and, considering the size\nof the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.\n"However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn\'t happen,"\nhe added. \n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nEvening Standard - 28 August 2002\n\n[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA]\n\n \'Lost\' penguins found alive\n \n by Charles Miranda\n\n A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in\n Antarctica has been found alive in a "big huddle". \n\n The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New\n Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica\n had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. \n \n Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made\n it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in\n October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: "The\n penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a\n successful breeding season over the winter." \n \n Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall\n and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research\n station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the\n cape, may have lost up to third of its population. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm\n\n\nBig cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record\nnumbers, a monitoring group has claimed. \nThe British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of\nanimals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers\nover the past 12 months. \n\nAnd while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the\naverage moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.\n\n\nSociety founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the\ncritics and doubters, adding: "I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same\nrealm as the Loch Ness monster. \n\n"But it\'s not, they are really out there." \n\n\'Cats with cubs\' \n\nMr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the\ncountry. \n\nBig cat reports  \nHotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire \nJanuary 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx \nNovember 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat \nApril 2001 - Lynx captured in north London \n1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  \n"This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,\nKent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire," he said. \n\nThe society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. \n\nBut Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in\nsufficient numbers to breed among themselves. \n\n"We have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added. \n\n\'Trigger camera\' \n\nThe society claims to have evidence proving the cats\' existence, including\nphotographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. \n\nBut it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public\nthat it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. \n\nA national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes,\nwill provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. \n\nMr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and\ntake a picture of itself." \n\n\'Like dogs\' \n\nThe society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the\nwild, or their descendants. \n\nIts spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big\ncats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. \n\n"But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people\nreleased their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them\ndown, or take them to a zoo."\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm\n\nUS soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable\ntranslation device will be an essential part of their equipment. \nScientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a\nspeech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. \n\n"This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation\nsystem can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today\'s tools,"\nsaid the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published\nrecently. \n\nThe research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding\nitself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. \n\nSpeaking in tongues \n\n"In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," Robert\nFrederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. \n\n \nTranslators could be essential for US soldiers\n \n"In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up\nand you are holding them apart. \n\n"You can\'t just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and\ntalk to them," he said. \n\nThe portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially\navailable laptops. \n\nThe Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.\nSo instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. \n\n"The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and\ntypically don\'t have any translation support," explained Mr Frederking. \n\nSlow system \n\nFor the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who\nknew just a smattering of English. \n\nThe system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in\nCroatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated\ninto English and read out by a speech synthesizer. \n\n"It went reasonably well half the time," said Mr Frederking, though it was\nslow in translating phrases. \n\nThe research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the\nfield. \n\nBut they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to\nwork with further research and development. \n\nThe Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between\nthe US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity. \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nAnanova:\xa0 \nBrazilian bees keep their own \'insect ranch\'\n\nScientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by\nkeeping herds of insects.\nThe Amazonian Schwarzula use their own \'insect ranches\' to provide food and\nbuilding materials.\nThe bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a\nspecies called cryptostigma.\nCryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees\nstop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.\nThe insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees\nscrape off and use for their nest.\nNature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in\nbees.\nBiologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: "In\nturn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."\nWriting in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry\ntheir insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further\nresearch on how they tend to their herd.\nStudies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar\nfrom the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.\nStory filed: 13:49 Wednesday 28th August 2002\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nNot fortean, but a moment in time all the same...\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm\n\n\nBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after\nlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. \nBetamax\'s manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000\nmore machines for the Japanese market. \n\nThey have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. \n\n \nVHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s\n \nBetamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better\nquality than its VHS rival. \n\nSome 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,\n1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the\nfilm rental industry and in homes. \n\nJust 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. \n\n"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the\nmarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to\nsecure parts," Sony said in a statement. \n\nSony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the\nformat. \n\nThe professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the\ntelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. \n\nBut the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin\nfor Betamax home players. \n\nIn the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. \n\nBetamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of\ncompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. \n\nThe picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,\nalthough VHS tapes had a longer duration. \n\nA total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no\nnew ones will be made after the end of 2002. \n\nSony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies. \n  See also:\n\n\n \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the\nregion, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.\nThe WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes\nof food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.\nThe government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government\'s\ncampaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has\nworsened the situation, say many donors.\nLost markets\nThe GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.\nZambia\'s president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling\nit as \'poison\' .\nDeals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be\nplanted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.\nUnited States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that\nAmericans eat GM maize every day.\nThe World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption\nand says it does not constitute a danger to people\'s health.\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nThe Times\n\n September 06, 2002\n \n Scissors are a snip for Third World\n From Richard Owen in Rome\n \n \n \n IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the\n millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from\n passengers’ hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized\n as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain\n is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World\n hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail\n files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for\n them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the\n X-ray scanners. \n \n Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that\n scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin\n America. \n \n He told Corriere della Sera that he had “plucked up the courage” to ask the\n authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a\n retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure\n sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. \n \n Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,\n Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. “In such countries, what we think of as a\n personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.” \n \n The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports. \n \n \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

'\n\nThe Times\n \n \n September 06, 2002\n \n Hitler-style applicant welcomed by parties\n By Roger Boyes\n \n \n \n MANAGERS of Germany’s political parties are having difficulty explaining their\n enthusiastic reaction to a man who applied for membership with letters cribbed\n largely from Mein Kampf, Hitler’s personal manifesto. The incident illustrates\n how indiscriminate parties have become in taking on new members during an\n election campaign, even when their sentiments bear a suspicious resemblance to\n those of the Führer. \n \n “Edmund Stoiber is a thousand times more suited to leading Germany than the\n present Chancellor,” said one letter sent to the Christian Social Union\n headquarters in Ingolstadt. “Chancellor Schröder is doing nothing to stop the\n flood of foreigners who are spreading around our Fatherland,” said the letter,\n signed by a certain Rudolph Lewald. \n \n The CSU immediately spotted a potential member. “Many thanks for your nice\n thoughts,” replied the local party manager, who enclosed an application for\n membership. \n \n The letter used chunks of Hitler’s book, which is still banned in Germany.\n History students have to apply for access to the book in university libraries.\n \n \n “The strongest, the brave and the hardworking will receive the birthright of\n existence, only those who are born weaklings could regard this as offensive,”\n the letter-writer said. “So-called humanity is melting like snow in the March\n sun.” Such phrases were lifted from Mein Kampf, which was written while Hitler\n was in jail after the failed Munich putsch of 1923. \n \n Similar letters, also using the Nazi leader’s words, were sent to the other\n political parties and drew sympathetic responses. “I read your letter with\n great interest and pleasure,” the manager of the Christian Democratic Union in\n Cologne, said. \n \n “Great that you want to join us!” enthused the Green Party headquarters. The\n Free Democrats invited the aspiring party member to a fundraising charity ball\n at which Hans- Dietrich Genscher, the former Foreign Minister, would be the\n star guest. The Social Democrats sent a list of rallies to be attended by\n Gerhard Schröder, the Chancellor. \n \n “I wanted to test how serious parties are about combating right-wing\n extremism,” said the letter-writer, who was in fact the Cologne novelist\n Rainer Popp. “I had no idea that they would be so enthusiastic. \n \n “For the first few days I expected two men in leather coats from the Special\n Branch to knock on my door. Instead only the postman called — with packets of\n election material from zealous political headquarters,” Herr Popp said. \n \n “I was stunned that political parties could react in this way — I reckon I\n would have had the same response if I had signed the letter ‘Adolf Hitler’.”\n \n \n \n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!

Typically packages use /usr/local as default\n(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in\n/usr/local/doc and so forth).\nNormally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not\nfurther specify things like --exec-prefix.\n\nMaybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in\nwhich case ignore me!\n> That worked fine so I moved to the next step.\n> make\n> At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:\n> Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el\n> make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255\n> make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp\'\n> make: *** [w3] Error 2\n> \n> When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.

I\'m not a C programmer,\nbut I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are\ninstructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile\nprocess, and include all sorts of symbols/functions\ne.g. "#include <math.h>" gives you maths type functions.  Since they\nstart with "#" they are ignored in the final compilation.\n\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this\nis the right way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the steps above regarding "make dep" and so forth\nshould have been performed in the directory where the make process is\nlooking for modversions.h & Co.\n\nI don\'t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as\nyou describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you\nhave done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after\nthat, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)\nfiles.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files\ndon\'t really belong there).\n\nFor what it\'s worth I think you are very close to a successful\ncompilation.\n\nm\n\n> \n> Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed "make", I noticed\n> that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h\n> file.

"\n\nHi All,\n\nI have a question which is a bit tricky and was\nwondering of anyone has come across this problem\nbefore or could point me in the right direction.\n\nI am involved in porting a SCO unix application to\nLinux, and we have encountered a problem with the way\nsemaphores  are being handled. The application uses\nmulitple processes to run application code with the\nmain process known as the bsh which controls all i/o\nbe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled\nvia semaphores.\n\nIn certain circumstances the main process and the\napplication child process seem to lock up both waiting\nfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I\nhave attached ddd to the processes and it seems that\nthe semaphore code is doing the correct things for\nsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the\nsemop() system call.\n\nI have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay\nbetween changing semaphore states the problem goes\naway, but this causes our entire application to run\nreally sloooww !! lol\n\nIs there anything weird or different with the standard\nimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could\ncause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state\n\nin a semaphore immediately?\n\nSetting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==\nEAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails\n(-1) also fixes the problem but again system\nperformance goes down the toilet.\n\nboth the parent controlling process run as the same\nuid, and the parent creates the semaphores with\npermissions 0666.\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated!\n\nRgds,\n\nColin Nevin \n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

'\n\nhttp://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802B\n\n\n\nThe Disappearing Alliance\nBy Dale Franks 10/08/2002\n\n\nFor over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our\nclosest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the\nCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We\ncelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation\nof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.\n\nTragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.\n\nEurope has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that\nHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed "progressive\ntransnationalism". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist\nprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the\ndeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of\ncitizenship (i.e. a "global" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and\nthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the\nUnited Nations.\n\nThe European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the\npooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there\nis a European Parliament, the EU\'s power resides mainly in the unelected\nEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits\nto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where\nelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an\nappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,\nwhose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,\nthe EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of\nthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired\nby the EU\'s political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice\nregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member\ngovernments. This is a step backward in Europe\'s political development.\n\nEuropean criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of\ncomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact\nthat our republican system of government is not based on proportional\nrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise\nthe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy\nis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear\n- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere\nin the world.\n\nOn August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK\'s Independent\nnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be\nrestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade\nor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it\nexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because\nthe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of\nthe US literally fantastic.\n\nAt least, for now.\n\nDespite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact\nremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European\nintellectual and political elite.\n\nThe Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in\ncheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a\nsystem in Europe, they feel it\'s valid for the rest of the world. America,\nhowever, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot\nunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national\nsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it\ndoes on compliance with international "norms." They view all departures\nfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal\nvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the\nprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble\nwith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,\nauthoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic\nsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.\n\nThus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals\nto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the\nliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its\ndictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references\nto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to\ncomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,\ntherefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a\ncommitment to\nconstitutional rights.\n\nNone of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or\ncooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in\nfavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while\ntheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a\npolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably\nincrease.\n\nThat thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the\nthought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the\nnew ideology of transnational progressivism.\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \nand the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \nJust look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \nclass had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \nthere was some of that. But the main difference between my son\'s text \nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \nhistory. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \nreciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \nfor easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \nof freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \nbecome possible to see the federal government\'s main function as \nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \ninterests.\n\nEven now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you\'d find \nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \nmuch over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \nestate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It\'s \nan insider\'s game, less because the players are secretive than because \nthe public and the press—encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon—\ncan\'t get themselves interested.\n\nOne corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \nCommunications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \ndenizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \ncommerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \nthe commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \nprice: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \ngrumblingly attend the Chairman\'s Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \nthe high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \ncomedy routine by the commission\'s chairman.\n\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \nAmericans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \nAmerican economy, as well as important aspects of daily life—telephone \nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \nF.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \n"corporate scandals" concerns the economic collapse of companies \nregulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \namong others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \npart of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \nembodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \npast two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \nof dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\n\nThis year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \nof the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \nF.C.C. World\'s feverish mood ("The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns") \nand suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \njust quoted is followed by this explanation: "The ILECs appear likely to \nenter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \nresidential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs." It\'s a lot easier to \nthink about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\n\n\nEven in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \ncommission\'s chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \nintense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \nitself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \nPowell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \nUnlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \ngenerates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \nwho he really is and what he\'s really up to. Powell is young to be the \nhead of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. \nEverybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \none of the F.C.C.\'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \nF.C.C.\'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \narcane details of communications policy. He\'s always saying that he\'s an \n"avid moderate." And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \npredecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \nto Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \ncalls him "radical and extreme." Just as often as he\'s accused of being \na right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \ncautious. "It ain\'t about singing \'Kum-Ba-Yah\' around the campfire," \nanother former chairman, William Kennard, says. "You have to have an \nanswer." One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \nsubcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \nsubcommittee\'s chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \nhim. "You don\'t care about these regulations," Hollings said. "You don\'t \ncare about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That\'s the \nfundamental. That\'s the misgiving I have of your administration over \nthere. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \nseem to not care at all. I think you\'d be a wonderful executive \nvice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \nregulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \njob?"\n\n"Extremely," Powell said, with an amiable smile.\n\n\nOne cannot understand Powell\'s maddening effect, at least on Democrats \nand liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \ncreated by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \nNew Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \ncases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \nother original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \nthe national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \nunfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \nwell-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \nsupervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \namong communications companies so that it didn\'t become too bloody, by \nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \nIn addition to looking out for the public\'s interest, the commission \nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \nterrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank \npresident and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \nAccording to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \nin the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \nanti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \nstation in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\n\n\nF.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \nniches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \nbreakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \ncommission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \nself-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \nago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \nlong-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \nwhich customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \ncompany. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \nmid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \nphone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \nto offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \ntelephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a "natural \nmonopoly," requiring protection from economic competition and total \ncontrol over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \nthe F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \nand the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \nconsumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \nprosperous, too.\n\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \none of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \nmost people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \nmodernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \nbargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \nas "baby Bells" and to F.C.C. World as "arbocks" (the pronounced version \nof RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \noffer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \ncustomers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \ncompetition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \neconomics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \nVice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \nhelping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \nbrought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \njobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \nbeneficiaries might become the party\'s new contributor base. Clinton\'s \nslogans about the "information superhighway" and "building a bridge to \nthe twenty-first century," which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \nsent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \ncorrelates of the Telecom Act, and Gore\'s cruise to the Presidency was \nsupposed to be powered substantially by the act\'s success.\n\nThe F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \naggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \nall important interest groups they work with both parties); they \nimmediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \nrule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \nReed Hundt, who was Gore\'s classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \nthe arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \nlike A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \ncompanies, "see-lecks" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \nlocal exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \nequivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \naccess to the arbock\'s switching equipment, the arbock won\'t give the \nseeleck a key to the room where it\'s kept, so the see-leck asks the \nF.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\n\nPartly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \nhe would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \ncondition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \nsee-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \ninto other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \nboom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \nand other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt\'s \nformer lieutenants told me, "Reed used to joke that my job was to make \nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."\n\n\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \nboom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \nComcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \nbelieved that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \nundiscriminating.)\n\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \ndetermined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \nchairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \ninfluence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \nThree Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \nHarold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \nPatrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \nsuch, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \npowerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \nS.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \nthat the arbocks didn\'t want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \nmight be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \nwasn\'t as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \nFurchtgott-Roth.\n\nPowell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \nbefore a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \ngave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \nfree-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore\'s Law)—that \nbegan by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \ntelecom companies alive. "In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas," Powell said. "Like the \nWhos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \nbeast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act\'s \nfertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \nleast, so it is thought." Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \nchairman he didn\'t expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \npart of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \nof the Bush Administration.\n\nTwenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \nor dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \nserious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \ncompanies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \nconcentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \ncompanies\' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \ngood shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \ncompanies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \nif they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \nduopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \npoor health of the long-distance companies.\n\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \ncompanies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \ndon\'t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \nfully control what material they allow to enter people\'s homes. As part \nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \nTelecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \nsignificantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \nradio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \nper cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \nprogramming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \nof Viacom.\n\nIn this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \nbe hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \nto breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \ndisallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \nforces of concentration. It should use the government\'s money and muscle \nto get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \nhomes of people who can\'t afford it at current market prices. (An \nanalogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \nthe Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \npeople, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \npeople blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \nexpectations and stirred too many passions.)\n\nBut Michael Powell\'s F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \nF.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \nsignals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \nthe F.C.C.\'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn\'t mean he has \nbeen inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \ninfuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \nthe provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \nF.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he\'s \nhaving the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital \ndivide"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \n"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I\'d like to have one and \nI can\'t afford one." At the National Cable & Telecommunications \nAssociation convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \ntumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \nsomersault.\n\n\nNot long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \nWashington, near the city\'s open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \nthe western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \nEven the chairman\'s suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \nfluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \nwalks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \njeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \nof the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \nthe idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \nthe market before the fact—"prophylactically," as he likes to say—should \nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \nlitigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \nthen became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government\'s \nlegal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \nthe New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell\'s political \nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \nalso maintains close ties to Bush\'s nemesis Senator John McCain, of \nArizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \nenduring love of law school—"It\'s sort of like a law-school study \nsession over there," one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \nconfirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \nstudents, summer interns at the commission, whom he\'d invited to sit in.\n\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \nof the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n\n"I think we\'ll never know," Powell said. "I don\'t think it\'s an \nautomatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \nthe best analogue. We don\'t seize all the land in the United States and \nsay, \'The government will issue licenses to use land.\' If my neighbor \nputs a fence one foot onto my property line, there\'s a whole body of law \nabout what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it\'s a \nsimilar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \nspectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \nof ways that we\'re accustomed to."\n\nTalking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \ndoesn\'t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \nironic air quotes. He\'s like your libertarian friend in college who \nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \nsees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \nthought his predecessors\' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct had been excessive.\n\n"I would start with a caveat," Powell said. "Look, I can\'t fault those \njudgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \nBut, frankly, I\'ve always been a little bit critical. First of all, \nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesn\'t come anywhere close \nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \non down, about the kinds of things it\'s going to open up. I mean, I \ndon\'t know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \nor what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \nreading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \nBut, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \nexcitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \ncertainly was.\n\n"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \nexpectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \neconomy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \nexaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by \npoliticians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \ngold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \nthat government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \nsee numbers go up on the board."\n\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. " \n\'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \nthirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \nBells to bleed! Then we\'ll know we\'ve succeeded.\' " Now Powell returned \nto being Powell. "I think that expectation was astonishingly \nunrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they\'re \nthere. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There\'s no \nquestion, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \ndebt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business \nmodel."\n\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better? "We could have \nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system," \nPowell said. "Money chased what seemed like government-promised \nopportunity. The problem with that is there\'s a morning after, and we\'re \nin it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \nways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."\n\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \nhad been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "No, we wouldn\'t have \nevery home in America with competitive choice yet—but we don\'t anyway. I \ndon\'t think it\'s the remonopolization of telephone service. I don\'t buy \nthat. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn\'t? The \npart of the story that didn\'t materialize was that people thought so \nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint."\n\nOther local phone companies, he added, hadn\'t materialized as viable \nbusinesses, either, and they never might. "Everybody\'s always saying, \n\'The regulators did this and this and this.\' But, candidly, the story\'s \nquite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \nyears to give them a chance. Conditions don\'t get that good except once \nevery thirty years, and it didn\'t happen. So, whatever the reason, we\'re \nlooking at a WorldCom that\'s teetering. We\'re looking at a long-distance \nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \nbreaking itself up. Sprint has struggled."\n\nCould the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \nstronger? "At the F.C.C.? I think I\'ll just be blunt. My political \nanswer? Yes, there\'s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \nto help. But I can\'t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \nI can\'t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \ninvestigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don\'t have \nthose kinds of levers. I don\'t know whether anybody does. At some point, \ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \ndying." Powell couldn\'t have made it much clearer that he doesn\'t think \nit\'s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \ngestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \nF.C.C.\'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \ncommunications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \nout the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \nup the telecom industry.\n\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \nservice. "Yes," he said. "It concerns us that there\'s one of each of \nthose things, but let\'s not diminish the importance of there being one \nof each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \ncapabilities, even if they aren\'t direct analogues of each other." \nAnyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \nprovide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \nprovide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \nis, Does it stay that way?"\n\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \npeople confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \nwhich distorts markets. "If this were just economics, it\'s easy. If you \nwere to say to me, \'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,\' we \nknow how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \nmarket\'s too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \nother dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \nthe question of, if everybody\'s controlling what you see, the assumption \nthere is that somehow there\'ll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \nviewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won\'t get diversity. I \nthink that\'s a possibility. I don\'t think it\'s nearly the possibility \nthat\'s ascribed to it sometimes."\n\nPowell explained, "Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \nparochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \nexists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \nthe planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \nand then we have policies like"—here his tone went from ironic to \nsarcastic—"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \nof what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \nand opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \nfairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."\n\n\nF.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \ncan\'t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \nhe regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \nmarket, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he\'s carrying \nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \nAttorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn\'t want to do anything \nat the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he\'s \nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \nso that he doesn\'t wind up going first and getting caught in the \ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \nnetworks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \nTelecom, after Colin Powell\'s idea that the United States should never \ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \nand an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \nsays, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \nirreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n\n"This is why elections matter," Reed Hundt, who isn\'t happy about what \nhas become of his Telecom Act, told me. It\'s true that the F.C.C.—much \nmore than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore \nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \nAdministration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \nthere\'s no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \nhave done if Gore had won. Next election, they\'ll help the party that \nhelped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \narbocks\' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks\' rivals—the \nlong-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts—with their \nfriends now in power, will stage a comeback. America\'s present is not \nunrecognizably different from America\'s past.\n\n\n'

'\n\n\n\nI have translated the article in full - see \nend of post (I think that I\'ve done a far \nbetter job than the Google translation - at \nleast it\'s readable now - any corrections\nappreciated).\n\nStuff in {}\'s is my (and others) additions \nto the debate.\n\nMy apologies if I\'ve paraphrased anybody \nincorrectly, I will be glad to retract if \nanyone is miffed.\n\n\n\nThe article makes four main points.\n\n\n1) Absence of critical clauses. \n\n\nIn this case, the idea is that the licence \nis invalid because it doesn\'t specify\nunder what country\'s law the GPL is governed.\n\n\n2) Specification in English only.\n\nThat for the end user (as opposed to businesses), \nthe GPL doesn\'t apply because it\'s not written \nin French.\n\n\n3) Arbitary licence change.\n\nThe point here is that (under French law) the \nauthor can change the terms of the licence \narbitarily. This is because any granting of \nrights by an author must be clearly delimited\nin terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and \ntimes. In the absence of such limitations, the \noriginal author has the right to change his \nsoftware back to closed on a whim.\n\n\n{\n\nDavid Neary makes the point that the copyright \nholder automatically retains the right to change \nthe licence.\n\nScott replies it simply requires authorisation from \nall *copyright holders*\n\nThat\'s not my understanding. French law allows a \nGPL type licence *_on condition_* that the \nspecific conditions of the granting of such\nrights are clear - if they are not, there is\nnothing to stop the original author taking\nback "his work". The lawyers see this\n(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).\n\n}\n\n\n\n4) Hidden defects.\n\nRoughly, this clause means that the author(s) \nis/are liable for any defects if the consumer \nis not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up \nand data is lost, then the authors are liable.\n\n\n{\n\nCiaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have \nsimilar clauses - the point here is that they \nare *_all_* invalid - just that this one \naffects the GPL also.\n\nNiall O\'Broinn makes the point that it is not\na sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement\nand that\'s why it doesn\'t come under this point.\n\nI would suggest that the whole thrust of this\narticle has been to see software "sales" (even\nif no money changes hands) as governed very\nmuch by consumer law (in France anyway).\n\n\nRick Moen makes the point that it is not\na sale but rather a granting of rights which\nare not default. \n\nSee the bit about even the granting of \nrights by an author having to be \nexplicitly specified - under French law.\n\n\nThe fact that two IP lawyers in France think that\nthe GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that \nthere is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.\n\n}\n\n\n\n5) Roughly.\n\nThere may be other reasons under French \nlaw why the  GPL may be invalid.\n\n\n\n-----  Whole Article. -----------\n\n\nFreedom(a) is worth more than these \nimperfect licences.\n\n\nSpecialised lawyers look at the GPL.\n\n\n\nLawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to \nthe court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both \nspecialised in the area of intellectual property \nexamine the "free" licences and in particular the \nGPL. They have published their study\nin the review "Proprietes intellectuelles \n(Intellectual property)[1]" and their\nconclusion is grim.\n\n\nTheir approach is interesting. The problem for \nthem is not to know whether freedom is valid under \nFrench law (for them the question is a moot point)\nbut rather they asked themselves about the form \nand the content of the text of free licences, and \nin particular the GPL. The problem is not free \nprogrammes, but rather the licence contracts of \nfree programmes.\n\n\n\nAbsence of critical clauses.\n\n\n\nThe authors tell us that first of all, the \nreference to "copyright" is not legally \nsufficient in the framework of international \ncontracts  (which is the case of licence \ncontracts for programmes developed and spread \nvia the Internet). The idea of copyright can \nbasically include differences from one country \nto another. This is why, under international \ncontracts, it is necessary to specify to which \nlaws one is referring (French law, American &c.).\n\nThe authors only found three public licences \nwhich were correctly formulated on this point: \nQPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public\nLicence).\n\n\n\nSpecification in the English language.\n\n\n\nNext, the authors remind us that (at least in \nFrance), no clause in a contract may be contrary \nto French law [2]. However, it turns out that a \nlicence such as the GPL is contrary to French law \nin several respects. Firstly, it is written in \nEnglish and the FSF doesn\'t officially approve \ntranslations. \n\nThe "Toubon law" obliges this sort \nof contract to be written in French, including for \nbusinesses since the notion of "user" applies not \nonly to consumers, but also to businesses, \nprofessionals &c. \n\n\nContacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, \nlawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as \nfar as business is concerned, the "Toubon \nlaw" is probably doomed to change since \nit is in contradiction of European directives \non the subject, but whatever about that, the \nproblem is still valid for individuals, and \nwhile waiting for it (French law) to change, \nFrench companies have to deal with it, since \nit is the law of the land.\n\n\nA programme under the GPL can suddenly \nchange licence.\n\n\nAnother problem, much more serious, is \nthat according to French law, the author of \na free programme can, at any time, invoke \nthe invalidity of the licence for this \nsoftware by simply changing the licence.\n\n\nIn effect, the law of intellectual \nproperty stipulates that the granting of  \nrights by the author is subordinate to \nthe condition that each of these granted \nrights be the object of a distinct clause \nin the granting act (i.e. the licence) and \nthat the granting of any such rights be \ndelimited with respect to its scope and its \ngrantees, and also with respect to its \nlocation (i.e. where such rights may be \nexcersised)  and duration of any such grants. \n[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of\nother free licences. Briefly, this means \nthat in France, or elsewhere if the author \nis French, that which is under the GPL could \nrevert to proprietary from one day to the next. \n \n\n\nThe problem of the guarantee "hidden defects".\n\n\nAn other very serious flaw is that of the \nguarantee. The GPL licences and others show \nthat the software is delivered "without \nguarantee". You are going to immediately\nreply that commercical programmes carry the \nsame clause in their licence contracts,\nand this is correct. However, whatever is \nwritten in a licence contract, one cannot\nfree oneself from the "guarantee from \nhidden defects", since it is imposed in the \nCivil Code. This concept is poorly understood \nby the layman, it protects the buyer\n(whoever it may be, individual or business, \nsince it specifies the Civil Code and not \nconsumer protection law) against hidden \ndefects, deliberate or made in good faith by \nthe seller. \n\n\nFor example, if one buys a pair of socks \nin a sale, and the shop has a notice \nspecifying that "Sale items are neither \nrefunded nor exchanged", and on arriving \nhome you notice that one of the socks has \na hole in it, several scenarios are possible.\n\n\nYou could have checked the socks before \npurchase: the flaw is deemed "obvious" and\nyou can sing for your money.\n\n\nYou couldn\'t check the socks (they were \npackaged for example), and in this case, \ndespite the notice "neither refund nor \nexchange", you may invoke "hidden defect" \nand have them changed or obtain a refund, \nit\'s up to you. \n\nPersonally, I have already invoked in shops \nthe "hidden defect" clause and it always \nworked well (shopkeepers are always very \ncooperative if you quote a couple of words \nof the Civil Code). \n\n\nThe concept of hidden defect is rather \nwide, it is necessary that you hadn\'t \nthe possibility of discovering the defect \nbefore buying the product and then \n(according to the Civil Code) that you \nwouldn\'t have bought it at that price if \nyou had known about the\ndefect.\n\n\nThe third case which is much rarer , is \nif you are able to show that the vendor had\nknowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn\'t \ninform you. In this case, not only does he \nhave to reimburse the product, but all \nexpenses incurred by the sale (metro \ntickets to go to the shop, the fuse \nwhich blew when you plugged it in &c.)\n\n\nThis idea of "hidden defect" applies to\n all products, including programmes. This \nwas made abundantly clear by the \nauthorities (and the courts) surrounding \nY2K. \n\nThis is particularly inconvenient for \nfree programmes, since a site which \noffers a Linux distro for download is \nsupposed to provide a guarantee against \nhidden flaws.\n\n\nLinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if \nin the case of a free programme, \none could speak about a "hidden" defect \nsince the source code was available, \nhe replied "Actually, concerning the \nguarantee, the question of obvious \ndefect will arise. This analyis will \nbe different depending on whether the \nperson who downloads the distribution \nis an IT professional or not". \n\nOpenSource has this advantage over \nthe proprietary programme: it protects \nthe distributor against a guarantee of\nhidden defect insofar as the buy is an \nIT person. But, for distribution to the \npublic at large, the problem remains \nthe same.\n\n\n\nRoughly Speaking.\n\n\nLawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, \nthis study is far from being exhaustive \nand many other areas could be explored. \n\nDuring this interview, we asked ourselves, \nfor example, about the fragility of the \nGPL clause which forbids linking source \ncode under the GPL with proprietary code. \n\nIn effect, the laws of intellectual \nproperty give the right to the user \nto modify a programme with the\nintention of permitting interoperability \nwith another programme. If for that,\nI need to link with a proprietary library \n(communication protocol, device driver)\nI may consider as "null and void" this \nclause of the GPL.\n\n\nThe conclusion of this study is a wake \nup call for the community. "Freedom" \nmerits more than these shoddy licences, \nwhich should be modified before court \ncases over them proliferate and put at \nrisk the undeniable originality of \nthis effort.\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[1] Une publication de l\'Institut \nde recherche en propriété \nintellectuelle, No4 Juillet 2002\n\n[2] Une telle clause de contrat \nqui est opposée à ce que dit la Loi \nfrançaise est qualifiée en terme \njuridique de « clause réputée \nnon-écrite », c\'est-à-dire \nqu\'on fait comme si cette clause \nn\'était pas écrite dans le contrat. \n\nC\'est pour cela par exemple que vous \npouvez signer un bail pour un \nappartement qui stipule que \nles enfants sont interdits dans \nl\'immeuble, et envisager sans \ninquiétude d\'avoir quand même \nun enfant, en effet le code civil \nstipule que le devoir d\'un locataire \nd\'un appartement doit se comporter \nen « bon père de famille » \n\n[3] Article L131-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!? -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en français !\nYahoo!

'\n\nThis article from NYTimes.com \nhas been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu.\n\n\nTexas Pacific, in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below, actually does invest in promising new companies, not just turnarounds. It\'s just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!\n\nRohit\n\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\nTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend\n\nAugust 25, 2002\nBy RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG \n\n\n\n\n \n\nIt was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when\nhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways\nlast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner\nand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and\nrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped\nthrough his files and found the number for the Texas\nPacific Group, an investment firm headed by David\nBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation\nfor fixing problem companies. \n\nMr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,\nhad watched Texas Pacific\'s partners turn an investment of\n$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed\nfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600\nmillion. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in\nAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. \n\nThat search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let\nTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways\' revival? asked\nRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.\nSiegel reached. \n\nIn June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days\nbefore US Airways announced its plans to file for\nbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated\nabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas\nPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to\nkick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep\nthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to\nbuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,\nand take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\nfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a\nbetter offer. \n\n"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks\nwere," said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in\nan interview after the bankruptcy filing. "There aren\'t\nmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge to\ndelve into the airline industry." \n\nTexas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying\nbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman\nmade their names during the recession of the early 1990\'s\nwith investments in Continental and America West. The\nfirm\'s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping\ncompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its\nextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. \n\nNow the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last\nyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six\nacquisitions, most in unloved industries like\nsemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,\nit announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been\nlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding\nfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. \n\nThe most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these\ndeals could be Texas Pacific\'s acquisition last November of\nMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6\n- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150\nmillion bank loan. \n\nIn the last few years, most firms that specialize in\nleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and\nother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -\nhave been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made\nmanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are\nfor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. \n\nTexas Pacific is different. "This is a terrific environment\nfor them," said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the\nBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. \n\nMark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the\nWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: "Most\nother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.\nYou don\'t see many guys wanting to take on operational\nfixes." \n\nLike most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep\nits inner workings private: its partners rarely grant\ninterviews and its Web site is perpetually under\nconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,\nthe third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for\nthis article. \n\nMr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and\nbright, patterned socks. "He likes argyle socks, and they\ntend to fall down around his ankles," said Henry Miller, an\ninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in\nhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman\nargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. \n\nWhen a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known\nfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking\nin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.\n"Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on\nmy caller I.D., I know it\'s David calling," said one\ninvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. \n\nMr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980\'s as the\nchief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.\nMr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making\nearly bets in industries like cable television and taking\nstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,\nwhich had been seized by the government. Over nearly a\ndecade, Mr. Bonderman\'s picks earned an average annual\nreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. \n\nIn 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.\nCoulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also\nworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with\nMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &\nCompany, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. \n\nThe three men have complementary skills, investment bankers\nand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master\nstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and\nthe detailed management of the firm\'s purchases. Mr. Price\noften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. \n\n"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal\nmaker," said Greg Brenneman, a former president of\nContinental. "Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.\nHe will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will\napproach investments a little bit more skeptically than\nDavid does." \n\nBy the end of the 1990\'s, Texas Pacific was well\nestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion\nfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To\ncelebrate their war chest, the firm\'s partners rented San\nFrancisco\'s City Hall and hired the B-52\'s to play at a\nparty. \n\nBut as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific\nhesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no\ndeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate\nblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but\nstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the\nbusinesses untenable. \n\nInstead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\ninvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during\nthat stretch. \n\n"They started to cash out early in the cycle," said Mario\nGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money\nmanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\ninvestors. \n\nThe good times of the late 1990\'s were not ideal for Texas\nPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\nneeded its help. \n\nBut Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\nrough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health\nmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\nmid-1990\'s, almost doubling its money after bringing in new\nmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a\n$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian\nmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than\nquadrupled. \n\nBut Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at\nthe top of the market. Texas Pacific\'s $560 million\ninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for\nwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,\nhas been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of\nBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand\nfor luxury goods. \n\nTexas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a\nsemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,\nboth of which filed for bankruptcy. \n\nSome of these investments have taken a toll on the firm\'s\nperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\ntwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. The\nfirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\nincluding investments made through March 1997, should\nreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific\ninvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997\n- could return less than half that, this investor\nestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on\nthese investments before the stock market sank. \n\nBut because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\nin the second fund, profits on these investments could\nrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new\nmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as the\neconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, "their\nreturns look pretty good when you consider that some other\nfunds won\'t return any capital" to investors. \n\nBut with the weak economy throwing many companies into\ntrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\nsuccess, the investor said. "They should do exceptionally\nwell," he said. \n\nTexas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It\nrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure\ntroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except\nfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it\nreplaces managers. \n\nLess than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,\nfor example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his\nold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it\nto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. \n\nContinental\'s board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then\nbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and\nin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief\nexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul\nof the company and is now considered a great turnaround\nartist of the industry. \n\n"The biggest conflict I\'ve ever seen was with Bob\nFerguson," said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for\nthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the\nthinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982\nBraniff bankruptcy. "He chose Bethune over his longtime\nfriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\nbetter job." \n\nAt America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more\nextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was\nled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. \n\nW. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.\nCoulter\'s home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\nchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.\nParker said the two men quickly realized they had "somewhat\nkindred spirits." \n\nThe board replaced most senior managers at America West,\nexcept William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped\ndown last September. His restructuring plan had made the\nairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\nbankruptcy in August 1994. \n\nTexas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth\nabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and\nthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. \n\n"These are not passive investors, nor am I," said Donald L.\nSturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental\'s\nboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. "You\'re active.\nYour money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake." \n\nAfter overseeing managers who worked successfully with\nunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a\ngood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways\nwas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris\nChiames, a spokesman for the airline. \n\nMr. Siegel wanted an investor who would "be as labor\nfriendly as possible," Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can\nstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the\nbillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed\ninterest. \n\nTexas Pacific\'s investment in Burger King, made with\nGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two\nyears of discussions among Texas Pacific\'s partners and the\nchain\'s franchisees - even before the company, which had\nbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for\nsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National\nFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger King\nfranchisees. \n\n"We liked what they had to say about the human component of\nthe businesses they buy," Mr. Josephson said. Many other\nowners, he added, "are dismissive of labor." \n\nAt Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an\nexecutive it knows. Burger King\'s chief executive is John\nDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,\nwho met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest\nbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. \n\nUnlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored\nwith the technology industry, despite the failure of so\nmany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the\nsemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is\nhighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. \n\nThe firm\'s 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,\nwhich makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,\nhas been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and\ntook both parts public in the late 1990\'s, selling most of\nits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger\ninvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip\nmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in\nAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for\nbankruptcy last year. \n\nTexas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third\ncompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6\nbillion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last\nyear. \n\nIts latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,\nmay prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the\npayment to E.On, based in Düsseldorf, Germany, was actually\nmore than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal\nsaid. \n\nTexas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company\nof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to\nguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas\nPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of\nwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. \n\n"They did a good job of timing the acquisition," said\nNabeel Gareeb, the company\'s chief executive, who noted\nthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit\nsince the fourth quarter of 2000. \n\nBut Texas Pacific\'s interest in airlines is clearly\nsizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America\nWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,\nthe catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. \n\nTwo years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount\nticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75\nmillion in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to\ninvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.\nHotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as\nPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site\nbut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until\nafter the sale. \n\nThe contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt\nHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that\nthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific\nremains committed to it. \n\nLast spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to\ntalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman\nseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the\nsteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,\nMr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,\nMr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. \xa0 \n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6b\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

'\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nThugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess\n\n\nThe Geodesic Economy\nRobert A. Hettinga\nSunday, August 25, 2002\n\n(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.\nPatriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war\nbetween thugs.\n\nPut crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang\nwere the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha\'s "family" were, of\ncourse, the (mostly) Italian thugs.\n\n\nThink Scorsese\'s upcoming "Gangs of New York", only with\ncounter-reformatory overtones. Hoover\'s South Boston "social-club"\nputsch, starting in the mid 1960\'s, was particularly audacious in\nhindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite\na reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation\'s rackets by\nthe Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not\nfor New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,\nonly makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to\nits ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime\nthere once and for all.\n\nThe result, as we all found out, wasn\'t swapping the heroin of\nItalian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,\nposthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine\n- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence\nin Whitey Bulger\'s crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston\'s drug markets,\nlike the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other\nalso-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of\nmagnitude, not mere percentage points.\n\nAs Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it\'s own. And, make\nno mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that "quality"\nof carnage, nation-wide.\n\n\nSo, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one\ngang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at\nleast, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with\napparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on\nthe gears of "justice" like so much hamburger.\n\nHowever, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was\n"greasing", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could\nlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --\non paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,\nbut still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken\'s famous "bluenoses\nand busybodies".\n\n\nIt all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of\nbeginnings. What she couldn\'t do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy\nthen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a\nsmaller, "manageable" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more\nheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,\nin more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.\n\nEvery time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or\nharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,\napparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing\nhappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead\nyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely\nlucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently\nscale newly-legislated "barriers to competition" imposed on them by\nthe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of\nthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of\nevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly\ncoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred\nliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.\n\nAs Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don\'t need\ngovernment if nobody\'s breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to\nParkinson\'s Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,\nbreaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they\nconfiscate at tax time.\n\nAnd, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably\necho here his father Milton\'s famous observation that government\nregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and\nnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,\n*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in\nthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our\ngovernment now imposes on us.\n\n\nAnd there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.\n\nIn fact, Hayek himself, in "The Road to Serfdom", couldn\'t have\npredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover\'s blatant\nimposition, "for our own good", of Vietnam-era statist power at the\nneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn\'t have had\nbetter "useful idiots" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an\nabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.\n\nUseful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who\nwere eating out of Hoover\'s power-craven hand for the entire middle\nof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger\'s hand, whether they knew it\nor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you\'ll notice, which\nsaw the increasingly steady imposition of "mob" violence, and market\ncontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the\nimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,\nmovie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little\nCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now\nstrictly political, descendents.\n\nIn terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.\nSalvati and the others, dead or alive, as a "transfer-price", in\nhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style\nVietnam-era Keynesian "social-cost" input-output accounting at its\nmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that\nwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic\ncontrol, in the name of what really was, as you\'ll now agree, just a\nrace war between thugs up in Boston.\n\n\nThis shouldn\'t be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least\nfought by thugs, though they\'re usually conceived elsewhere, and\nendorsed, at the time, by all the "right" people, for all the "right"\nreasons.\n\nAs far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson\'s observation\nthat a "prince" is just a stationary bandit.\n\nThough, given his penchant for women\'s clothing, for other men, and,\nwhat\'s actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of\npeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.\nEdgar Hoover a bandit "princess", instead.\n\n"Bandit Queen", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --\nand real bandits -- everywhere.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n- ---------\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines=\n&pagewanted=print&position=top\n\n\nThe New York Times\nAugust 25, 2002\nHoover\'s F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX\nBUTTERFIELD\n\nBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar\nHoover\'s war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional\ninvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\nNew England\'s organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.\n\nTwo gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.\nPatriarca\'s permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,\n"as they were having a problem with him," according to an F.B.I. log\nof the conversation. "Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.," the\nF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an\nalley, shot six times.\n\nIt was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\nMafia was involved.\n\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real\nkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were\nleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to\ndeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing\nto do with it.\n\nOne, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.\nfor $300 million for false imprisonment.\n\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the\nJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.\'s Boston\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob.\n\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca\napproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation\nby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the\ndepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.\n\nThe documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently\nincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\nprotecting them from prosecution.\n\n"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\nhimself," said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati\'s lawyer. "He allowed a\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\none of his informants."\n\nMr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and\nmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark\nwho worked for Mr. Barboza.\n\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.\nSalvati\'s innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a\nspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the\npending litigation.\n\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\nmisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the\ninvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\nF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and\nStephen Flemmi are brothers.\n\nThe Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,\nRepublican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau\'s knowledge\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.\nDeegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,\nincluding who fired the first shot.\n\nThen, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover\'s office demanded to know what\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.\n\nIn a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston\noffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca "potentially\ncould be an excellent informant."\n\nThe agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have\nkilled seven men, "and, from all indications, he is going to continue\nto commit murder." Nevertheless, the agent said, "the informant\'s\npotential outweighs the risk involved."\n\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. "The most\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi\'s murders,\nthe director does not even respond," the investigator said. "There is\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant."\n\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\npressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\npower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.\nagents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties\nto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.\nBulger.\n\nBoth sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and\nthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled\norganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger\'s gang was able to take\nover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while\nthe F.B.I. looked the other way.\n\nOne reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.\nPatriarca\'s involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional\ninvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device\nin his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who\ntranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information was\ncoming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,\nthe investigators say.\n\nMr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted\nin 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on\nparole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state\njudge after the Justice Department task force made public documents\nsuggesting his innocence.\n\nTwo of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their\nsurvivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million\nlawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to\ndie in the electric chair. His life was spared only when\nMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.\n\nMr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston\'s North End with\nhis wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30\nyears. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put\non the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each\nother.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb\n3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI\n=OELD\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

In many places, it\'s \ncalled "advertising": "buy one, get one free", "free shipping on any order \nover $25", "buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free", "free popcorn \nwith any movie rental", "free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter", \n"the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore".\n\nAccess to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.

For example, audio recordings have such an\nexemption (dating from the early \'80s IIRC), which is why you can\'t\n(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can\ncontrol what you do with it after they\'ve sold it to you.  Certain\nindustries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --\nthere is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such\nprivileges on.\n\n \n> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.

If they can\'t figure out how to make\nmoney doing something, they\'ll actually burn money to make sure no\n"industry outsider" can either for all intents and purposes; control is\nmore important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a\nprofit.  They don\'t need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable\nbusiness behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few\npeople swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically\n"investigated" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar\nactivities, but that is mostly just for show.\n\nWhich isn\'t to say that the entertainment industry won\'t fall victim to\nits own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious\nprice manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

I *do* care about content.  Hell,\nif I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth\nall day, I\'d have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced\nthat they will (stupid or not).\n\nWhile a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same\nargument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who\ncommunicate by pictures?

I wasn\'t saying\nthat MMS wouldn\'t take off because it wasn\'t high quality or that it wasn\'t\neasy.  I was saying that I couldn\'t see why people would use it in a way\nthat "changed the face of communications".\n\nI\'m looking for the compelling reason (even if it\'s a stupid one) why\npeople would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the\nphone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see\npeople taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to\nother people.  But, mostly, I don\'t see what the benefit is to this over\nsending them to someone\'s email address, or putting together an online (or\noffline) photoalbum.\n\nI don\'t think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics\nright away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That\'s\none of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant\nview part.  I\'m guessing your argument is that people not only want\n"instant view", but also "instant show".  Which is what this service\noffers.  I\'m not convinced that most people want "instant show".  I think\npeople like to package their pictures and show them.  That\'s why people put\ntogether fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while\nthey explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally "instant show" is nice, but\nit\'s just "nice" on occasion.  I still can\'t see how it becomes a integral\nmessaging method.\n\nWhat\'s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it\nfrom one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it\'s\nsilly if people are going to flock to it.\n\nI\'m searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.\n\nThe *only* really intriguing idea I\'ve heard about things like MMS lately\nare Dan Gillmor\'s assertion that one day in the near future some news event\nwill happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile\nphones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of\nwhat happened - before the press even gets there.\n\nWilling to be proven wrong,\nMike\n\nPS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as\nthey currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

'\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is MIME?\n\nMIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions".  It is the\nstandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the\nworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending\nimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text\nfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part\nof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a\nrecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. \n\nHow can I read a MIME message?\n\nSince MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use\nwhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing\nnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular\nMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the\nUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host\nftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)\n\nIn addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation\ncapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do\nnot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is\nstill hope! \n\nThere are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME\nmessage.  One of the more versatile is called "munpack".  It was developed\nat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the\nhost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions\navailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with\nolder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also\ndecode messages in split-uuencoded format. \n\nDoes MIME replace UUENCODE?\n\nYes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so\nthat they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical\nlimitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust\nencoding called "Base64" which has been carefully designed to survive the\nmessage transformations made by certain email gateways. \n\nHow can I learn more about MIME?\n\nThe MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via\nanonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: \n                                                       \n     o  US East Coast                            \n        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        \n                                                        \n     o  US West Coast                            \n        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      \n                                                        \n     o  Pacific Rim                              \n        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)  \n                                                        \n     o  Europe                                   \n        Address:  nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) \n\nLook for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt\n\nAnother source of information is the Internet news group "comp.mail.mime",\nwhich includes a periodic posting of a "Frequently Asked Questions" list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

'\n\nHi Kragen,\n\n   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple\nof nits I might pick (for example, I don\'t expect that the market will\nbe well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the\nmost important issue, which is that end users won\'t be able to fix\ntheir systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and\nyou allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you\nmight want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.\n\n   There\'s one other point which you don\'t make, which I think is very\nimportant, which is that research into defining and addressing classes\nof vulnerabilities can\'t happen without libraries of available\nvulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated\nmethods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about\nthe quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into\na set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you\ncan define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so\nyou can make and test predictions.\n\n   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we\nwouldn\'t have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.

This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers\n| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked\n| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people\n| wouldn\'t apply them because they didn\'t know how serious the problem\n| was.\n| \n| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and\n| exploit these same holes for months or years while the "responsible\n| disclosure" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the\n| underground, vulnerable.\n| \n| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known\n| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to\n| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,\n| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and\n| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less\n| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see\n| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so\n| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as\n| long as possible.\n| \n| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous\n| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in\n| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding\n| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  \n| \n| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently\n| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the\n| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software\n| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to\n| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP\'s Tru64 Unix secret if\n| HP retained Snosoft\'s "consulting services".  HP considered this\n| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the\n| information.\n| \n| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,\n| together, add up to a catastrophe.\n| \n| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to\n| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,\n| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime\n| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.\n| \n| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will\n| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be\n| --- just as in the "responsible disclosure" days --- that the good\n| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority\n| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.\n| \n| I\'ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the\n| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don\'t think that\'s\n| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets\n| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the\n| people who administer the software aren\'t liable, either --- when\n| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.\n| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site\n| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some\n| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.\n| \n| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability\n| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to\n| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that\n| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who\n| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.\n| \n| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as\n| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR\n| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in\n| Samba, for example.\n| \n| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either\n| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public\n| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or\n| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating\n| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly\n| increase the availability of that information to the people who can\n| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.\n| \n| Let\'s not let that happen.\n| \n| \n| \n| \n| This is the original iDEFENSE announcement:\n| \n| From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]\n| Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM\n| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE\'s Vulnerability Contributor Program\n| \n| \n| Greetings,\n| \n| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability\n| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance\n| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.\n| \n| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following\n| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:\n| \n| Q. How will it work?\n| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish\n| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number\n| of motivations, including the following:\n| \n|          * Pure love of security research\n|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks\n|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products\n|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure\n| \n| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the\n| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the\n| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following\n| items:\n| \n|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)\n|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided\n|          * The potential severity level for the information shared\n|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other\n|            software and hardware potentially affected\n|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs\n|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE\n| \n| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?\n| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other\n| entity.\n| \n| Q. Why are you launching this program?\n| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions\n| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More\n| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the\n| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is\n| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the\n| public at large are warned in a timely manner.\n| \n| Q. Who gets the credit?\n| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or\n| exploit information.\n| \n| Q. When can I contribute?\n| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.\n| \n| To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have\n| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please\n| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.\n| \n| Regards,\n| \n| Sunil James\n| Technical Analyst\n| iDEFENSE\n| \n| "iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively\n| monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and\n| hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code.\n| The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline\n| security professionals and network administrators with timely access to\n| actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats.\n| iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines\n| the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new\n| software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment."\n| \n| http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n| \n\n-- \n"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."\n\t\t\t\t\t               -Hume\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

What it boils down to is that\nonly the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. \nWhat I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively\nstill exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top\nexecutive and management positions in the major French firms and the\ngovernment, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not\nofficially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws\nand legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. \nEven for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them\nfrom branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many\ncan leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about\nthe French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about\nit (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect\nthis may hold true for other European countries as well.  \n\nAfter all those "revolutions", France is still nothing more than a\nthinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n'

It\'s kind of astounding that there is \nenough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* \nFAQ) and "eyewitness" reporting without a single written source. What \nthe essay below doesn\'t seem to answer, though, is what the earliest \nattributed quote in print by any other writer is. I\'d naturally be much \nmore skeptical if the "quote" emerged after his death... RK\n\n===============================================================\nhttp://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm\n\n"A billion here, a billion there . . ."\n\nDid Dirksen ever say, " A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon \nyou\'re talking real money"? (or anything very close to that?)\n\nPerhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio \nrecords of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found \nno evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to \nhim.\n\nArchivists undertook the search after studying research statistics \nshowing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote \nor its variations.\n\nHere is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed \n"Ev and Charlie" and "Ev and Jerry" shows, all newspapers clippings in \nthe Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen\'s own speech notes, \ntranscripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of \nRepublican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen\'s statements on the \nSenate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.\n\nAlthough Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to \nrely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular \nturn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or \nexcessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word "pothole" to \nremind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to \nthe debt ceiling:\n\n\n"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make \nthe deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were \nworking on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got \nthrough, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to \nthe hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic \nhazard.\n\n"Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a \nconference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and \nsaid, ‘I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth \nand remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.\'" \n[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].\n\n\nOn the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another "spending" story, \none he labeled "cat in the well":\n\n\n"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story \nabout a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, ‘Johnny, a cat \nfell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and \nthen fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the \nwell?\'\n\n"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a \nwhile, and then when the teacher came down and said, ‘How are you \ngetting along?\' Johnny said, ‘Teacher, if you give me another slate and \na couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes \nI can land that cat in hell.\'\n\n"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do \nnot find much to cheer about concerning it." [Congressional Record, June \n16, 1965, p. 13884].\n\n\nBut there are no such reminders for the "A billion here, a billion \nthere . . . " tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen\'s \nnote-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt \nceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no \nauthoritative reference to the "billion" phrase.\n\nThe chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from \npeople who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for \nexample, cites someone\'s personal observation on the campaign trail as \nevidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard \nDirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But \ncross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up \nnothing in the way of confirmation.\n\nThe closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican \nleadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, "The \nfavorite sum of money is $1 billion – a billion a year for a fatter \nfederal payroll, a billion here, a billion there." [EMD Papers, \nRepublican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the "and pretty \nsoon you\'re talking real money" is missing.\n\nIn another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted \nDirksen: "Look at education – two-and-one-half billion – a billion for \nthis, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five \nbillion for public works. You haven\'t got any budget balance left. \nYou\'ll be deeply in the red." [Cited in Byron Hulsey\'s "Everett Dirksen \nand the Modern Presidents," Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of \nTexas, p. 226]\n\nOf course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late \nSenator\'s comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not \nhave his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional \nRecords ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen\'s life and \ncareer – he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses \nclaim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen\'s campaign speeches \ntended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated \nnewspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, \nmeaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped \ncapture.\n\nBottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have \nendorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he \never coined it.\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n---\nMy permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu\n\n\n'

I\'ve written complicated mission-critical server software in\nJava that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is\nsitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running\nmonths at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing\nlots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure\nevery conceivable problem (and problems you didn\'t conceive of) recovers\nto a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a\ndesign/programming issue.\n\nThat said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then\nre-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn\'t scale well as a\nlanguage for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. \nThe problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly\ndetailed and low-level control of system resources to get around\nbottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don\'t give\nyou access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of\na C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune\n(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. \nNonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you\ncould conceivably develop in either language, as most aren\'t limited by\nraw performance scalability.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n'

Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C\nthan in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless\ncollection of libraries.

Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but\nlibraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even\nif they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't\nparticularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library\nthat really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.

He might have dreamed of becoming an\nace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to\nuse the Internet to end world hunger.\n\nBut as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he\'s harboring\ndifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.\n\nBesides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, "you\ncan\'t get the chicks with that anymore."\n\nThe tech industry\'s financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\nsome fair-weather students. But now there\'s another consequence of the tech\nbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\ncome to a halt.\n\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\n2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.\n\nThe word is out among department deans that the bust\'s fallout has trickled\ninto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of\nComputing Machinery.\n\n"I\'ve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\ndeclines," said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering\nat Princeton University in January. "It can be hard to see this, because at\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\nexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect."\n\nAt Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington\nUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\nscience fell by more than half this year.\n\nInterest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\npast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and\ncomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing\nResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees\nwere awarded.\n\nThe Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\nfastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other\ncomputer-related industries trailing close behind.\n\nBut in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among\ncollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\ncomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is\ndown to 800, although a newly created and more general information\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students.\n\n"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief," said Lloyd Griffith,\ndean of George Mason\'s information technology and engineering school.\n"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don\'t want to spend four\nyears on something and then not get a job."\n\nFreshman enrollment for the University of Maryland\'s computer science major\nis expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does\nnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland\'s College of\nComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\n\n"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major," Halperin said. "That\'s a\nfactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don\'t expect\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off."\n\nYandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not\nconvinced that\'s the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,\nwith a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his\nadvanced-placement exam in computer science.\n\n"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things," Yandziak\nsaid. "I\'m just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world."\n\nHarris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of\nAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.\n\n"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late \'90s; potentially you have the\nsame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, \'I don\'t need this\nkind of IT training right now,\' " Miller said. "Our concern as an industry\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the\nroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to\nfind themselves in a shortage situation."\n\nEconomic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other\nfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social\ninfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perception\nof computer science as an isolating, "nerdy" profession is one that many in\nthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.\n\n"All the hipness is gone," Yandziak said. "Once we thought of the Internet\nas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that\ncame along."\n\nLamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\nthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\nmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.\n\n"Technology comes natural to people my age; it\'s not fascinating anymore,"\nThompson said. "To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It\'s a\nnecessity, but I wouldn\'t take it any further."\n\n\n'

However, what I believe to really be the\ncase is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large\napplications with many components that involves the collaboration of more\nthan three programmers.  In those cases, it\'s always very hard to get the\nprogrammers to agree on API\'s, memory management techniques, etc.  With\nJava, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don\'t sit around in\na long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database\n(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).\n\n\n>3.

Most\nsystems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that\'s how i\'ve always\ndone it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools\nwhere you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.\n\nMemory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the\nhardware functions.

I agree this is the way\nthings will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the\napplication layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it\ngives geeks something to do and sells XML hardware accelerators and way more\nCPUs?\n\nIs there anyone out there actually doing anything new that actually IMPROVES\nthings anymore, or are they all too scared of the fact that improvements put\npeople out of work and cut #1 is the creators...\n\n- Adam L.

'\n\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.html\n\nMaking a mesh on the move\n\nA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, \nreports Peter Rojas\n\nPeter Rojas\nThursday August 29, 2002\nThe Guardian\n\nImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from \nanywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting \nfor the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or \ndownload the MP3 of the song that\'s playing in the pub before it finishes.\n\nThis is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the \nthird-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for \nyears. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new \ntechnology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision \nsooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever \ndream.\n\nTwo companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, \nare each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. \nInstead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, \nwith every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time \n"mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close \nproximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh \nnetwork. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying \ntraffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it \nreaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central \nantennas, and improving wireless coverage.\n\nAs the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and \nother devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless \nnetworking may be inevitable.\n\nMesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless \nnetworks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users \nconnection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a \ndial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection \nspeeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The \ntechnologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed \nwireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range \nprotocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even \nfaster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.\n\nThe range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of \nmuch use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the \nproblem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. \nEven though the range of any individual device is relatively small, \nbecause (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, \nconnections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless \nconnection.\n\nBecause mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed \nto create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building \ncellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all \nthat is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around \n£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the \nproper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by \nsoftware.\n\nIt also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. \nUnlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on \nis unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too \npleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds \nacquiring 3G licences.\n\nAll that\'s needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect \nto the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets \nbetter, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone \nnetworks.\n\nBut things get very interesting when you realise that when you have \nhigh-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone\'s laptops, PDAs, \nand mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing \nmusic, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When \nUltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.\n\nAt 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the \nperson sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. \nSooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of \ntheir favourite songs, movies, and video games.\n\nBut the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. \nMeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. \nInstead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities \nthat want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works \nemployees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the \ncheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for \nenterprise networks.\n\nThe first place average users may use the technology is when it is \nincorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at \nhigh speeds, which both companies see happening soon.\n\nWhen will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in \nyour pocket? It\'s too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service \nwas initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually \nsomeone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.\n\n\n\n\n'

The\ntraction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put\nthe motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice\ninto them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty\nof time to smoke anything.\n\nOf course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.\n\n\n"

In \nlate 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to \nco-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens \nof millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet \ntransaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his \ncompany for a king\'s ransom.\n\nNot bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.\n\nA programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to \nChicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a \nmission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure \npasswords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded \nPayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the \ncompany.\n\n"This company was founded on the notion of security value," Levchin \nsays. "Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning."\n\nThiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains \nfocused on security, which he says is the key to the company\'s good \nfortune.\n\n"I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction \nprocessor," Levchin says. "We spend a lot of time designing security so \nit doesn\'t step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. \nThe trade-off is fundamental."\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with \ne-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, \naccepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The \nservice extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and \nmore than 3 million business accounts.\n\nMost of PayPal\'s users are participants in online auctions, which led \nPayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. \nAlthough they were once rivals, the relationship between the two \ncompanies resulted July 8 in eBay\'s tentative $1.5 billion acquisition \nof PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.\n\nLevchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. "There are \nareas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."\n\nAlthough security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company\'s \nability to carry out open communications among the millions of \nparticipants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.\n\n"This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to \none another," he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld\'s \nNext-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20\n\nPayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And \nLevchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on \nexploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst \ncovering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.\n\n"If they didn\'t have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was \nsusceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up," \nLitan says.\n\nTo combat criminals, Levchin established "Igor," an antifraud program \nthat monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin \nsays building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. "The \nwork I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the \nwork makes Internet shopping safe. It\'s the view that ecommerce has \narrived."\n\n\n'

By\ncontrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such\nas completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process\npolls them.\n\nI don\'t think signals are a better way to do things in this case\n(although I haven\'t written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the\ntechnical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.\nMost programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous\nnetwork I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal\nqueue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().\n\n-- \n<kragen@pobox.com>       Kragen Sitaker     <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/>\nEdsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage\nregulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly\nthe energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16\nkilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic\nenergy, there\'s enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in\na vacuum.\n\nSuppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8\nkw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does\nthe 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet\nit isn\'t -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --\nthe speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored\nelectrically in the capacitor.  And it\'s not at all obvious that the torque\nvs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do\nit without wheels, drive train, etc.\n\nBut if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!\n\nOn to the Lunarnationals?

JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other\nsources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection\nAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.\n\nThe EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government\'s\npush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines\nand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.\n\nWhile acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of\nexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both\nanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer\nrisk to humans.\n\n"It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental\nexposure levels" as well, the report said. "The potential human health\neffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and\nuncertainties are involved."\n\nThe report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various\nworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularly\nsignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel\nemissions under the Clean Air Act.\n\nSome environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush\nadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that\nwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a\nseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.\n\nEPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with\nthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,\nthe EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone\nthe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to\nmeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.\n\nThe engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,\nalthough the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel\nis expected to produce pollution reductions.\n\nThe EPA\'s 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the\nprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to\ndiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when\ngauging pollution health concerns.\n\nBut in this case, the report said, "the exposure-response data are\nconsidered too uncertain" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of\ncancer risk to an individual.\n\nNevertheless, said the report, the "totality of evidence from human, animal\nand other supporting studies" suggests that diesel exhaust "is likely to be\ncarcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to\nenvironmental exposure."\n\nThe report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses\nshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a\n"chronic respiratory hazard to humans" contributing to increased asthma and\nother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for\nas much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.\n\nEnvironmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs\nto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road\ndiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency\nexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust\nsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.\n\nEmily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private\nenvironmental organization, said: "To reduce the public\'s exposure to\nharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement\nclean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent\nstandards for diesel construction and farm equipment."\n\nAllen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology\nForum, said the EPA\'s report "focused on the past," whereas "the future is\nclean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times\ncleaner than just a dozen years ago."\n\nThe report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in\nthe mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow\nturnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.\n\n\n\n'

"\n\nSo, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*\nlikes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\nmeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\nthe music playing.\n\nBy watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\nfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\nniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\n\nThe CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\ndoesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\nrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\ndisaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the\nbutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever\nget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\nsurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\nwhen the music doesn't play.\n\nFor toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\nwithin half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\nbutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't\nchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\npress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\nthe same.\n\nThe back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\ndisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\nCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a\nproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\nthat edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\nwiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but\nwhich hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\nhasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\nunderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\nCD.\n\nTatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\na mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the\nplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\nthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\nbut uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\nFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\nbinary distinction of music/no music.\n\nWhat would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\nplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\nwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\nThe other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\nthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\nthere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\nThe play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\nthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\ndevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\nopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\nshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'\nwithout affecting the player.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n\n"

Seems like every CD player should include the\ncapability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs \ninserted. \n\nPlayback would then never need to face seek delays... \nafter the initial ripping, the only use of the laser \npickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --\nwhich might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-\nfirst-track operation.\n\nYou could also take the CD out while it is "playing".\n\nHmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don\'t\neven have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through\nUI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of\nsome sort... and the player recognizes it from the \nsilkscreening. Kids would like that. "Play this," they\'d\nsay, facing the CD at the player, and the player would\nstart immediately.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n'

After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally\n  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for\n  nontrivial apps? No way!\n\nThe point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don\'t try\nto tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don\'t\ncare --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix\nhasn\'t been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you\nwere in elementary school, and operating systems without it don\'t\n"totally suck for nontrivial apps".\n\nFor what it\'s worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls\nfor a while, just in a way that doesn\'t scale to large numbers of\nconcurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc\nimplementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could\nprobably find much earlier references if I had time:\nhttp://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html\n\n(more details at\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/docs/io-events.html;\ndetails on the SGI patch are at\nhttp://oss.sgi.com/projects/kaio/faq.html)\n\n> > Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations\n> > have supported multithreading for a decade or more.\n> \n> And most UNIX is still kinda-sorta supporting the pthreads (POSIX)\n> interface, each in their own 7/8 implementation.

Now that I\'ve pointed out how obviously\nidiotic that claim is, you\'ve amended your complaint: now, although\nindividual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their\nimplementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads\nspecification.  Well, that\'s probably true, but I haven\'t written\npthreads programs in C much myself, so I can\'t confirm it from my own\nexperience.  But, even if it\'s true, it\'s not a very good reason to\nprefer Windows.\n\nI\'m sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading\nimplementations.  Spare us.

That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.\n(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)\n\nMost production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few\nreal world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were\ntalking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the "capactior is the\nwrong choice" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,\nit\'s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady\ndischarge curve.\n\nBut it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not\nthe 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those\nyou dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole\natoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with\na fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,\nand batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.\n\n- Adam L.

Although the PhD student has been\nblind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery\nand drinks.\n\n"I\'m putting your plate right in front of you," Zimmermann said. "I can\'t\nfind my mouth," one voice replied out of the dark. "I wonder what this dish\nis -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?" another invisible guest said.\n\nIn the "unsicht-Bar," which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose\ncomplete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like\na fish, meat or vegetarian option.\n\n"We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and\nsmelling," said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and\nsight-restricted people, which is running the bar.\n\n"People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over\nand are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent," he\nadded.\n\nOf the 30 staff, 22 are blind.\n\nAn average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to\nhelp, Scharnbach said.\n\nAnd at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have\nactually been eating.\n\n\n\n'

"\n\n\nRelated anecdote:\n\nI was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  \nThe only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language \nnewspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  \nEventually his story came out.\n\nHe had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  \nafter about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left\nhim, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,\nasking random asians for help finding her.\n\nI obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that\nthe possibility of mutual exploitation is high.\n\nAnecdote number two:\n\nIn college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with\nwho was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among\nother odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like\noffering them flowers.\n\nI asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who\nwasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a\nmail order bride.\n\nI was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much\nas anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.\n\n\n"

Combined with the very fertile\nnon-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a\nsignificant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the\npopulation would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for\nbeing able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,\netc.\n\nEurope did not show the same increase in fertility.\n\nSome actual data for the US are here:\n\nhttp://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf\nPart of:\nhttp://www.census.gov/population/www/pop-profile/profile2000.html\n\n- Jim\n\n\n"

Too many \nkids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be \ninfluenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I \nlearned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are \ntwo different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She\'s got her \nown place now, and still doesn\'t have one.  YaY!  Another thing that\'s \nwrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of \nindividuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending \non the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I\'ve seen Xi \ncome home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something \nthat happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It\'s a \nbig problem to tackle, and I don\'t know the answer.  I like the idea of \nthe voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more \nefficiently for how their kids are taught.\n\n \n>   > > > At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and\n> > > counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we\'re doing\n> > > something wrong.\n> > > \n> > > Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.\n> > > \n> > \n> > Maybe y\'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.\n> \n> m-w?\n> \nmerriam-webster.

'\n\nI recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, "Electronic\nPublishing", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.\nAll papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first\njournals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of\nthe better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly\nfrom 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).\n\nhttp://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.html\n\nToday\'s reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,\nsince they don\'t directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this\njournal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top\nresearchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the\nideas that led to many Web technologies.  It\'s one source among many for\nsifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing\ntechnologies.\n\nRohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the\ncontext of their WWW7 "Evolution of Document Species" paper:\n\nPage Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:\nA.

'\n\nDefinitional nit to pick:\n\nRobert Harley writes:\n> It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,\n> precisely identical between males and females.\n> \n> Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.\n\nYou\'ve redefined "promiscuity" above as "total" or "average" \nactivity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: \nactivity above some specific threshold (usually "one") or \nnorm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. \n"Promiscuity" is thus inherently a description of \ndistributions rather than averages.\n\nConsider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let\nthere be three pairings which result in each person\nhaving sex once. Then, let one of the males also have \nsex with the other two females. \n\nSure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners\nis equal between the sexes, tautologically. \n\nBut here more women than men are:\n - above the single partner threshold\n - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold\n - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners\n - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners\n\nAnd here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) \nnumber of partners.\n\nSo in this contrived population, females are more \n"promiscuous" than males, unless "promiscuity" is \ndefined uselessly.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n'

Overlay this with fiber map data\nfor yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is\nalso useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling\nexisting network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further\ndeployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.

There are still people who only have one partner.\nThere are many more whoe only have one partner over "long"\nperiods of time. So it is far from "vacuous" to describe some\npeople as "promiscuous" and others as "not promiscuous", \nespecially over a set period. ("He was promiscuous in college.\nHe is no longer promiscuous.")\n\nThe word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency \nto gloss that meaning over with population averages. \n\n> >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.\n> >[...]\n> >so in this contrived population, females are more "promiscuous" than males,\n> \n> So 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy\n> gets 3 girls.

Then, 1 man, let\'s call him "Wilt",\nalso has sex with the other 499,999 women. \n\n499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have\nonly had one partner.

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren\'t selling the software, which\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\n\nThe canopies we are talking about aren\'t short-range wifi technologies, but\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company\'s\nlong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to\nkeep things sane.\n\nOr at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,\nespecially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the\nsystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more\nefficient).\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n'

"\n\nHere are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with \nno reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to \nbe that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la \nWilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, \nev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more \npartners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether \nthe fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely \npromiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get \neven more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other \nmen. \n\n\nhttp://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html\n\n<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women \nis approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an \nindividual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we \nfind an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than \nthe mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just \none data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>\n\n\nAs for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme \npromiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the \nBand Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses \nhow, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you \nmight call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having \nmany partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an \nexplicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.\n    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of \nSchiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played \nin spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many \nothers. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that \nthere was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.\n\nTom\n\n\n"

These calculations only work if the\nobject is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah.

Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I \nreally should be doing something other than digging up the math for that.

'\n\nWell, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to\njust run Amithlon (or if that wasn\'t so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!\n\nThis is a near-term thing I could look forward to!\n\nHowever, an \'official\' laptop seems unexciting to me with only\nthe items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing\nthe listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:\n1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the\n   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is\n   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would\n   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.\n   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics\n   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,\n   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and\n    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)\n\n1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of \'internet keys\'\n    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll\n    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.\n\n1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)\n    in BIOS, please.\n\n2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan\n   to pull air through it, and if you don\'t elevate thelaptop off\n   the desk or table or bed it\'s on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good\n  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you\'ve got an\n  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)\n     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs\n  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display\n  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion\n  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)\n      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative\n  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle\n  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally\n  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them\n  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides\n  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little\n  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep\n  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) \n\n3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the\n    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to\n    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but\n    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified\n   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the\n   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with\n   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides\n   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted\n   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.\n     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,\n   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see\n   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of \'indian red\' that are great\n   candidates) base.  \n      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight\n    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-\n    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare\n    hood) to feed\n    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent \n    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.\n      The logo should be a coloration of a\n   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew\n   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/\n   at first blush.  We\'ll see what comes out of the contest and\n   maybe you\'ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the\n   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the\n   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.\n   MAA.org has more references, I\'m sure.\n\n4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.\n\nOther details:\nUSB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that\'s unavailable.\nOptions like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port\nshould round out the offering.  An option for just-released \n.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more\nreviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,\nand almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.\nCompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card\ninterfaces would be very pleasant.  I\'ve mentioned booting to\nUSB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.\nTo that end, a backup solution with compression using\nUSB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice \nbundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....\n\n\nBlue skies (and clear water and fresh air): \nWaterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.\nSvelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,\nbuiltin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and \nfrontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map\nand various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that\nsays \'This is Amiga Speaking\' when stroked \'round. \nDecent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps \nan ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as \nkeyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.\n2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple \n18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our\n(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.\nActual 7" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation \nfan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade\nRunner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling\nand airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user\nseat and provide mineral water.\nHyperTransport ports.\n\n\n'

In recent years,\nscientific research has suggested that people who have\nstrong friendships experience less stress, they recover\nmore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live\nlonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptible\nto the common cold, studies show. \n\nBut not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,\ninsult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too\nmuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling\nattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. \n\n"Friendship is often very painful," said Dr. Harriet\nLerner, a psychologist and the author of "The Dance of\nConnection." "In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,\nenvy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will\nrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing\nis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this\nis bad for my health and I\'m disbanding it." \n\nAnother book, "When Friendship Hurts," by Dr. Jan Yager, a\nsociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,\nadvises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.\n"There\'s this myth that friendships should last a\nlifetime," Dr. Yager said. "But sometimes it\'s better that\nthey end." \n\nThat social scientists would wait until now to spotlight\nthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering\nthat they have only recently paid close attention to\nfriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -\nbetween siblings or parents and children - have been seen\nas more important. \n\nOf course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead\nto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And\nchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships go\nbad. \n\nAs a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.\nLerner said, "Never once have I had anyone write and say my\nbest friend hits me." \n\nDr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the\nUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,\nlike a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the\nrole of friends in emotional and physical health. \n\n"Now that a marital relationship can\'t be counted on for\nstability the way it was in the past, and because people\nare less likely to be living with or near extended family\nmembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships as\na way of building community and finding intimacy," said Dr.\nFehr, the author of "Friendship Processes." \n\nUntil the past couple of years, the research on friendship\nfocused on its health benefits. "Now we\'re starting to look\nat it as a more full relationship," said Dr. Suzanna Rose,\na professor of psychology at Florida International\nUniversity in Miami. "Like marriage, friendship also has\nnegative characteristics." \n\nThe research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet\nmeasured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.\nSo far they have only, through surveys and interviews,\nfigured out that it is a significant problem. The early\nresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a\nfriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. \n\nHow can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by\ndrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised\npursuit. "When you think of people who were friends at\nEnron," she added, "you can see how friendship can support\nantisocial behavior." \n\nBetrayal also makes for a bad friendship. "When friends\nsplit up," said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of\npsychology at the University of South Carolina, "it is\noften in cases where one has shared personal information or\nsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."\n\n\nAnother form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend\nsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. "It\'s\nmore than just pulling away," she said. "The silent\ntreatment is actually malicious." \n\nAt least as devastating is an affair with the friend\'s\nromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.\nLerner\'s patients. "I would not encourage her to hang in\nthere and work this one out," Dr. Lerner said. \n\nA third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults\nthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who\nresponded to Dr. Yager\'s most recent survey on friendship\ndescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her\n"a derogatory name." The woman, now 32, was so devastated\nthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open with\npeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. \n\nEmotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,\nbut it is "more insidious," Dr. Yager said. "Some people\nconstantly set up their friends," she explained. "They\'ll\nhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or\nshe finds out." \n\nRisk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme\nkinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the\nonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying\nthe second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is\noverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person\nwho meddles too much in a friend\'s life, the competitor and\nthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. \n\nMost common is the promise breaker. "This includes everyone\nfrom the person who says let\'s have a cup of coffee but\nsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone who\npromises to be there for you when you need them, but then\nisn\'t," Dr. Yager said. \n\nSome friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,\nwhen one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons\nto dislike the other one. \n\n"With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to\ndiscover there\'s something important they don\'t like about\nthe other person," said Dr. Rose of Florida International.\n"One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other\nperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,\nit may take even more time for one person to meet the\nother\'s dislike criteria." \n\nWhether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,\n"depends on how large the injury is." \n\n"Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let\nsomething go," she added. "It\'s also an act of maturity\nsometimes to accept another person\'s limitations." \n\nAcceptance should come easier among friends than among\nspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one\nfriend and do not need a full range of emotional support\nfrom each one. \n\nBut if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where\none friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the\nfriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is\nto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal\nor intimate details of life, and start being too busy to\nget together, ever. \n\n"It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,\nbut only one to end it," Dr. Yager said. \n\nFriendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far\neasier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also\ncomparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a\nbad friendship should leave a person with more time and\nappreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. \n\n"It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have\nthem in order while you\'re healthy and your life and work\nare going well," she said. "Because when a crisis hits,\nwhen someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your\nhealth insurance, when the universe gives you a crash\ncourse in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and\nlife-preserving good friendship is."\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei=1&en=2a88a6d1b985c977\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n'

'\n\n\n==\nhttp://siliconvalley.internet.com/news/article.php/10862_1460701\n\nMicrosoft Tuesday said it has purchased a Mountain View, Calif.-based\nsecurity company to better secure its core file services including its\nWindows platform and .NET initiative.\n\nThe Redmond, Wash-based software giant has acquired the assets of XDegrees\nfor an undisclosed amount of cash and is in the process of relocating the\nteam of 12 or 14 engineers to the Microsoft campus.\n\nXDegrees\' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other\ndigital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network\n\nXDegrees founder Michael Tanne was offered a job, but decided instead to\nplay his hand in the Silicon Valley.\n==========\n\n"XDegrees\' technology assigns URLs to Word files, video clips, and other\ndigital documents for access across a peer-to-peer network" - assigns URLs\nto Word files... and somebody /bought/ that?\n\n===\nhttp://www.xdegrees.com/pr_2001-11-12_1.html\n"The XDegrees System allows users to easily and consistently locate, access\nand manage information by assigning each document a unique link. Providing\nend-to-end security, the XDegrees System unifies authentication of all\nusers, provides file-level access control and encrypts all stored and\ntransferred files. Seamless integration with existing applications such as\nemail clients and Microsoft Office products allows companies to rapidly\ndeploy the XDegrees System and users to get up-and-running quickly."\n\nWhoa... high tech...\n\n===\nMore bits here...\nhttp://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html\n\n"The essence of XDegrees consists of a naming system and a distributed\ndatabase that allows peers to resolve resource names. XDegrees manages these\nservices for customers on its own hosts, and sells its software to\nenterprises so they can define and run their own namespaces on in-house\nservers. You can search for a particular person (whatever device the person\nis currently using), for a particular device, for a file, or even for a web\nservice. The software that resolves resource names is called XRNS (the\neXtensible Resource Name System)."\n\n\n\n'
'\n\nI like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...\n\nhttp://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html\n\n"Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run\non the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be\nrun on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.\nOriginally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field\nstarted demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI\nand mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to\ngo back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the\nclient do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one\nimportant detail: the program doesn\'t have to reload when a new page is\nloaded, as JavaScript functions do.\n\nAnd because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access\nXDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their\nbrowser."\n\n===\n"Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a\nnew naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured\nout mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and\nbillions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of\nservers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai\ndoes), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default\n"home" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house\napplications."\n\n"Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the\nInternet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is\nmore sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth\nconnections can download portions, or "stripes," of a file from several\ncached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles\nthese stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that\nthe downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this\ndigital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header\nfor the file."\n\n\n'

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\n\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into "near-line" \narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \nrecovered on demand.\n\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor\'s MaXLine family offers \nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\n\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \nenvironments.\n\n"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \nfinancial documents and transaction records," said Mike Dooley, senior \ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. "Users may \nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \nenterprise applications."\n\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a \nthree-year warranty.\n\nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM \nUltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. \nThe MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation \nserial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum \ndata transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace \nwith the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive \nenvironments and enterprise applications.\n\nWith a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for \nmanaging hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA \nadvances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. \nThe interface\'s reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn \nallows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with \nincreased design flexibility and hot plug capability.\n\n"Maxtor\'s MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that \nhas previously been too expensive to keep on disk," said Dave Reinsel, \nanalyst at IDC. "The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and \nwhen integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling \ncost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have \nbeen the traditional solutions used for near-line applications."\n\nAvailability\nLimited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine \nII and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in \nthe fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus \nII with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments \nscheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.\n\nAbout Maxtor\nMaxtor Corporation (www.maxtor.com) is one of the world\'s leading suppliers \nof information storage solutions.

'\n\n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson091102.asp\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.\nThe Wages of September 11\nThere is no going back.\n\n\n\nSeptember 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\n\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans — all seen live in real\ntime by millions the world over — tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\ndealt in icons — the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\n\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\nrepugnant — and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\nghoulish not fearsome.\n\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\nthem both vile and yet banal — and so is confident and eager to eradicate\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\nparadise on earth.\n\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters —\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\nthe problems inherent in "the European way" became all too apparent:\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\nhobbits after September 11.\n\nAmerica learned that "moderate" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\nmeans nothing special to an American — at least not proof of being any more\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases — like NATO — belongs to a\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles — and as likely to come\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\noffer more long-term hope than "stable regimes" like the Saudis; governments\nthat hate us have populations that like us — and vice versa; the Saudi royal\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\n\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq "chicken\nhawks" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan\'s shrillness\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\nended than resonant of Patton\'s audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\ngeneration of Americans in the present military — other than a few thousand\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama — who have been in\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\n\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\nharm\'s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\nthousands in high-rises.\n\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\nso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.\n\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\nidealism — with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\n\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\nsubsequent terrible year — and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n'
'\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nSay \'amen\' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.\n\n\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the "good"\nof the city, and owned by an "authority" looking for something else\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world\'s richest\nnation.\n\nNow, of course, it\'s about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\ngovernment.\n\nAs a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\nbe "granted" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\nspecial-interest "communities", (or "stakeholders", or whatever the\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\nto such perfection.\n\n\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch\'s name.\n*Commerce*.\n\n\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\n"authority" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.\n\nIf the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\nevent.\n\nAnd, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\n\n\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\nand statism.\n\nIt\'s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\nit\'s going to happen sooner or later.\n\nAnd, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\ndied at the World Trade Center.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n- -------\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSeptember 11, 2002\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\n\nA Living Memorial\n\nAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\nperished would be a living one.\n\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.\n\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York\'s political leadership,\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\n\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute\'s Steve Malanga argues that the\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\n\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the city\'s\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\nanti-development agenda in the name of "honoring" the dead. One\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\n\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials, but we\'re confident\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world\'s financial center\nisn\'t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.\n\nIn this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\nyou\'ll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\naround the walls containing their names.\n\nIn New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city\'s future.\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he\'s out office, wants the entire 16 acres\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\non the "footprints," which, being in the center of the site, would\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\npress and has since ducked for cover.\n\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\n=09az\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

'\n\n\nhttp://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml\n\nDear Garrison,\n\nThere are at least six plans about what to do with\n"Ground Zero" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\nchildren\'s playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\nWhat do you think should done with the space?\n\nJoe Adams\nHillsdale, New Jersey\n\nI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\nthat\'s designed by committee and that\'s gone through\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it\'s going to be cold\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\nand that\'s the beauty of it, it\'s a city of young\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\ntowers, and it\'s not a memorializing city. Historic\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\nhistorical museums and in New York there\'s barely a\nlittle plaque. That\'s a great thing, in my estimation.\nIt\'s a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant\'s\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant\'s Tomb\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\n\n\n\n'

'\n\n\nGays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and\nthursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.\n\nThe WWE\'s gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed\nlast night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh\ncome on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it\not promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story\nlines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the\nenviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to\nhave finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.\n\nBut of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would\nrather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign\non the old killsawfiles.\n\nSO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say\nthat B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,\nthier "manager"*, for  pushing them to carry out their "gay" act far too\nlong and just when things look to be heating up with that story\narc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces\nthat they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the\nBisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie\nMcMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first\nlesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.\n\nOf course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this\naround, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier\nway to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be\nedited much though from the way I heard it.\n\nSo the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play\nacting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a\nface push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,\nthus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat\nand B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some\nheat time would be good for him as a single.\n\nAll this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4\nyear valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on\nborken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no\nlonger ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?\n\nWell, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz\nand Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.\n\n* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80\'s/early 90\'s.\nRicco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy\nwho goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.\n\n\n\n\n'

'\n\n\n"60 Minutes II" Bush Interview:\n\n(CBS)\xa0No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of \nlife in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly \n200 years ago, has seen the nation’s capital city successfully attacked. \nBut, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first \ngreat crisis of the 21st century.\n\nThis is the president’s story of September 11th and the week America \nwent to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air \nForce One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, \nthe president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he \nremembers Sept. 11.\n\n“I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for \nsome around the world to forget the mission, but not me,” Mr. Bush says \nduring the Air Force One interview. “Not me. I made the pledge to myself \nand to people that I’m not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So \nlong as I’m president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to \njustice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.”\n\nThe memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley \njoined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II \nwanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first \nhours after the attack.\n\nNot since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane \nbeen so central to America in a crisis.\n\nFor President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. \nBefore dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before \n6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad \nAtta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, \nhijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the \nairliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet \nengines echoed in Manhattan.\n\nAtta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.\n\n“I thought it was an accident,” says Mr. Bush. “I thought it was a pilot \nerror. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a \nterrible mistake.”\n\nMr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a \nclass of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just \nafter nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was \nthe sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was \na coordinated attack.\n\nBack in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the \nnews on his pager. The president’s chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.\n\n“A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack,” Card \ntold the president\n\nWhen he said those words, what did he see in the President’s face?\n\n“I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said,” Card recalls. “I \nthink he understood that he was going to have to take command as \ncommander-in-chief, not just as president.”\n\nWhat was going through Bush’s mind when he heard the news?\n\n“We’re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we’re going to do \nsomething about it,” Mr. Bush recalls. “I realized I was in a unique \nsetting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was \nlooking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I \ncan remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to \nget the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident \nthat we were, you know, that the world had changed.”\n\nMr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called \nthe vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the \nattack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first \nwords to the nation.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America,” he said \nin the speech. “Today, we’ve had a national tragedy.”\n\nIt was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didn’t know that two more \nhijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick \nCheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent \nran in.\n\n“He said to me, ‘Sir, we have to leave immediately’ and grabbed, put a \nhand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the \ndoor of my office,” Cheney recalls. “I’m not sure how they do it, but \nthey sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.”\n\n“There wasn’t a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice \npresident,” says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his \ncommand center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First \nFamily. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. “We knew there \nwere unidentified planes tracking in our direction,” he says.\n\nCheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the \nPresidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this \nwas it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice \ncalled Mr. Bush.\n\n“It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get \nout of the West Wing,” says Rice. “They were hurrying me off the phone \nwith the president and I just said, he said, ‘I’m coming back’ and we \nsaid ‘Mr. President that may not be wise.’ I remember stopping briefly \nto call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, ‘I’m fine. You \nhave to tell everybody that I’m fine’ but then settling into trying to \ndeal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I \nthink the thing that was on everybody’s mind was how many more planes \nare coming.”\n\nThe Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret \nService executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of \nsuccession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become \npresident if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President \nCheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says \nwhen he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the \nWhite House, no matter what.\n\n“It’s important to emphasize it\'s not personal, you don’t think of it in \npersonal terms, you’ve got a professional job to do,” says Cheney.\n\nCheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers \nhearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the \ncapital.\n\nSays Mineta: “Someone came in and said ‘Mr. Vice president there’s a \nplane 50 miles out,’ then he came in and said ‘Its now 10 miles out, we \ndon’t know where it is exactly, but it’s coming in low and fast.’”\n\nIt was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, \nthe first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.\n\nAs the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bush’s limousine sped toward Air Force One \nin Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - \nwas taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in \nthe West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer \nMillerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.\n\n“I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled \n‘Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run,’ and suddenly \nthe gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and \nthe whole White House just flooded out,” she recalls.\n\nIn Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling \na Secret Service agent “Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters \nprotected.” At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, \nblasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications \nDirector Dan Bartlett was on board.\n\n“It was like a rocket,” he remembers. “For a good ten minutes, the plane \nwas going almost straight up.”\n\nAt the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center \nTower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche \nof steel, concrete and human lives.\n\n“Someone said to me, ‘Look at that’ I remember that, ‘Look at that’ and \nI looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and \nthe horror of that moment,” recalls Rice of the TV newscast.\n\nShe also felt something in her gut: “That we’ve lost a lot of Americans \nand that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of \ncourse I felt the anger.”\n\nDown in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked \nplanes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.\n\nAs the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether \nto shoot them down. “I discussed it with the president,” Cheney \nrecalls. “‘Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these \nairliners that have been hijacked?’ He said yes.”\n\n“It was my advice. It was his decision,” says Cheney.\n\n“That’s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot \ndown your own civilian aircraft,” says Bush. “But it was an easy \ndecision to make given the – given the fact that we had learned that a \ncommercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it \nwas, I didn’t hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be \ndone.”\n\nThe passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They \nfought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. \nThe flight was 15 minutes from Washington.\n\n“Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of \ngovernment as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the \nWhite House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us \npsychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too,” says \nRice.\n\nMeanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 \nminutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of \nits twin.\n\nThe image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure \nlocation somewhere in Washington. “I was horrified,” she says. “I \nthought, ‘Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can.’ It was a \nnightmare.”\n\nBy 10:30 a.m., America’s largest city was devastated, its military \nheadquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf \nCoast.\n\n“I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the \nconsequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining \nmoment in the history of the United States,” says President Bush. “I \ndidn’t need any legal briefs, I didn’t need any consultations, I knew we \nwere at war.”\n\nMr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the \nhorrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to \nCheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, \n“This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.”\n\n“I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says \nthe president. "Information was just flying from all directions.”\n\nChief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David \nhad been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bush’s ranch.\n\n“I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or \nthat the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of \ndifferent information,” says Card.\n\nThey also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the \npresident there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code \nname for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, “Angel is next.” The \nthreat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.\n\n“It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get \nthe president home,” Tillman says. “We actually have to consider \neverything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to \nmake sure that no one knows what our position is.”\n\nTillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret \nService agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The \ncrew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from \nair traffic control – a suspect airliner was dead ahead.\n\n“Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an \nairliner off our nose that they did not have contact with,” Tillman \nremembers.\n\nTillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal \ntraffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought \nthat was a good idea, except the president.\n\n“I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such \nthat it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national \nsecurity team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back,” says \nBush.\n\nSo Air Force One set course for an underground command center in \nNebraska. Back in Washington, the president’s closest advisor, Karen \nHughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. \nBush.\n\n“And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, \nsounded very shaken said, ‘Ma’am, I’m sorry, we can’t reach Air Force \nOne.’” Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the \nattacks. When she came back, it was a place she didn’t recognize.\n\n“There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in \nblack, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to \nsee something like that in, in our nation\'s capital,” says Hughes.\n\nWhen she walked into the White House, no one was inside. “I knew it was \na day that you didn\'t want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, \n‘Hello?’ and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running \nthrough the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to \nthe location where I met the vice president.”\n\nOn Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most \nvisible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He \ndidn’t want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening \nto air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the \ntelephone.\n\n“We actually didn\'t tell them our destination or what directions we were \nheading,” says Tillman. “We, we basically just talked to \'em and said, \n\'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly \nacross the United States.\'”\n\nControllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning \neach other to keep the route secret.\n\n“OK, where’s he going?” one tower radioed to another.\n\n“Just watch him,” a second tower responded. “Don’t question him where’s \nhe\'s going. Just work him and watch him, there’s no flight plan in and \nwe’re not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?”\n\nAir Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed \nback: “Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 o’clock position.”\n\n“The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside \nhallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows,” \nsays Bartlett. “And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the \npilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.”\n\nThe men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the \nTexas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander \nwouldn’t tell them where they were going.\n\n“He just said, \'You’ll know when you see it,\' and that was my first \nclue, I didn’t have any idea what we were going up until that point,” \nsays Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.\n\n“We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force \nOne, and we\'d investigate anything that was within 80 miles,” says \nRoberts.\n\nBush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this \naircraft, or for his own safety: “I looked out the airplane and saw two \nF-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to \nget us.”\n\nWe now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, \na false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, \nwith the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He \nhadn’t appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly \nworried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, “The American \npeople want to know where their dang president is.” The staff considered \nan address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force \nOne to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At \n11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.\n\n“The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, \nwe will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless,” Bush \nsaid to the nation from Barksdale.\n\nAt Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington \nwas still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command \ncenter where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications \ngear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had \na job for press secretary Fleischer.\n\n“The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that \nwas said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed,” says \nFleischer\n\nFleischer’s notes capture Mr. Bush’s language, plain and unguarded. To \nthe vice president he said: “We’re at war, Dick, we’re going to find out \nwho did this and kick their ass.” Another time, Mr. Bush said, “We’re \nnot going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.”\n\nThe President adds, “I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I \nsaid, ‘We’re going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you \nand Dick Myers,’ who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, ‘are \ngoing to go get them.’”\n\nBy 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in \nNebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that \ngave no hint of what they would find below.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground \nCommand Center. It was built to transmit a president’s order to go to \nnuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching \nthe skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. \nAfter a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference \ncenter which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI \nand the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.\n\nAccording to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls \nthat Tenent answered: “Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. We’re doing the \nassessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.”\n\nThe evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an \nessential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.\n\nA flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence \nof mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the \nseat numbers of the hijackers. “That was the first piece of hard \nevidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in \nthose seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those \nindividuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and \ngoing through a process of elimination,” says Mueller.\n\nIn Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the \nnation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had \nenough. He decided to come back.\n\n“At one point, he said he didn’t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him \nout of Washington,” Fleischer says. “That verbatim.”\n\nOn board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: \n“I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that \nyou\'re guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists \nlike al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The \nother thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition \nof countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.”\n\nAs Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America \ncollapsed, one of the nation’s worst days wore into evening. At the \nWorld Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in \nPennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.\n\n“Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would \ntake innocent life the way they did, anybody who\'s so devious, is evil,” \nBush said recently.\n\nMr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in \nWashington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the \nway to the White House.\n\nWas there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White \nHouse to return to? “I don’t remember thinking about whether or not the \nWhite House would have been obliterated," he recalls. "I think I might \nhave thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to \ntake our best shot.”\n\nMr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. \nHis next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff \nwere already working on the speech.\n\n“He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was \nreassurance,” remembers Hughes. “We had to show resolve, we had to \nreassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.”\n\nJust off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become \nknown as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those \nwho harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. \nBush didn’t think the American people wanted to hear it that night and \nhe was emphatic about that.\n\nHe prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first \nheard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty \nmillion Americans were watching.\n\n“Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under \nattack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,” he said \nfrom the Oval Office that night.\n\nThe Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American \nhistory since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House \nresidence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White \nHouse daily log: “The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. \nWe think it\'s Osama bin Laden.”\n\n(CBS)\xa0When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No \none in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the \npresident would do. In office for just eight months, he’d never been \ntested as commander-in-chief.\n\n“I never asked them what they thought,” President Bush said of the \nPentagon brass, “because I didn’t really – because I knew what I was \ngonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set \na strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and \nbring them to justice.”\n\nIn the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: “The \ndeliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against \nour country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war,” he \nsaid.\n\nTo the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor \nCondoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to \nstrike bin Laden’s organization well before Sept. 11.\n\n“The president said, ‘You know I’m tired of swatting at flies, I need a \nstrategy to eliminate these guys,’” Rice recalls.\n\nIn one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didn’t \npick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without \na sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for \ncame too late.\n\nChief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for \nwas “literally headed to the president’s desk, I think, on the eleventh, \ntenth or eleventh, of September.”\n\nOn Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - \nwho to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who \nworried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate \ncruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in \nthe past.\n\n“Well, there’s a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway,” Mr. \nBush tells Pelley. “A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than \nthey should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense \n(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what \nwe called ‘boots on the ground.’ That if you’re gonna go to war, then \nyou’ve gotta go to war with all your assets.”\n\nThe president says he wanted to “fight and win a guerilla war with \nconventional means.”\n\nIt was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director \nGeorge Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and \nintelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the \nTaliban government.\n\nSecretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already \ndeveloped a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an \nunconventional solution to an unconventional problem.\n\n“As I like to describe it to my friends,” Powell says, “we had on the \nground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some \nCIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the \nbest in the world. How do you connect it all?”\n\nThe president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day \nbefore, he had called the Pentagon the “mightiest building in the \nworld.” Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American \nFlight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush \nleft, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering \nthe remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.\nThe next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the \npublic never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but \nthis one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. \nThe Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.\n\n“He wasn’t real receptive to that, to that recommendation,” remembers \nBrian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. “And he ordered a \nhamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening \nand that’s what he did.”\n\nThe next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the \npresident. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet \nmeeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.\n\n“He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it,” \nsays Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have \ntrouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service \nlater that morning.\n\n“And I just scribbled a little note to him,” Powell recalls, “and I \nsaid, ‘Mr. President, I’ve learned over the years when you are going to \ngive a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will \ncause you to start to tear up.’ He looked at me and he smiled and then \nat the next break in the conversation he said, ‘The Secretary of State \ntold me not to break down at the memorial service,’ and that broke the \ntension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.”\n\nFirst Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and \nshe says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. “I wanted \nthe Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think \nwe were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.”\n\nIt also stirred the mourners’ resolve, as Rice remember. “As we stood to \nsing the Battle Hymn of the Republic,” she says, “you could feel the \nentire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind \nof spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.\n\n“We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had \nbeen lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what \nhad happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually \ngoing to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.”\n\nNext came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for \nwhat he encountered there.\n\n“You couldn’t brief me, you couldn’t brief anybody on ground zero until \nyou saw it," Mr. Bush says. “It was like – it was ghostly. Like you’re \nhaving a bad dream and you’re walking through the dream.”\n\nThe president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men \nand women at ground zero began to chant, “USA! USA!.”\n\n“There was a lot of bloodlust,” the president recalls. “People were, you \nknow, pointing their big old hands at me saying, ‘Don’t you ever forget \nthis, Mr. President. Don’t let us down.’ The scene was very powerful. \nVery powerful.”\n\nWhen Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, “We can’t hear \nyou.”\n\nThe president responded, “I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of \nthe world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down \nwill hear all of us soon.”\n\nMr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; he’d posed with \nthe firemen who always stood by whenever the president’s helicopter \nlanded there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the \npicture were dead – lost at ground zero.\n\nWhen the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the \nfaces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished \nin an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just \nmissing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.\n\nAt a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several \nhundred of these families in a convention hall.\n\n“People said to me, ‘He’ll come out. Don’t worry, Mr. president, we’ll \nsee him soon. I know my loved one, he will - he’ll find a place to \nsurvive underneath the rubble and we’ll get him out.’ I, on the other \nhand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and \ncry, but I remember the whole time thinking, ‘This is incredibly sad \nbecause the loved ones won’t come out.’”\n\nOne little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his \nfirefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the \nboy, “Your daddy won’t believe that I was here, so you show him that \nautograph.”\n\nIt was an effort “to provide a little hope,” the president recalls. “I \nstill get emotional thinking about it because we’re dealing with people \nwho loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their…wives who loved \ntheir husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for \nall of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at \ntimes. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I \nstill feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my \ntears, I see opportunity.”\n\nThe president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; \nhe stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. \nThe body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground \nzero.\n\n“I called the police department,” Howard remembers, “ and they said he \nhadn’t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, \n‘No, I don’t need to call back.’ If he hadn’t called in, I knew where he \nwas.”\n\nGeorge Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 \nwhen the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, \nand he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldn’t stay away. The police \ndepartment gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.\n\n“He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me,” Howard recalls. “And \nhe extends his sympathy to me and that’s when I asked him I’d like to \npresent George’s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who \nwere killed over there.”\n\nBy the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.\n\n“He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was \nemotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted,” recalls Card..\n\nThe next day – Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war \ncabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.\n\n“My message is for everybody who wears the uniform – get ready. The \nUnited States will do what it takes,” Mr. Bush told them.\n\nAs Powell remembers it, “He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was \nlistening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he \nwanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.”\n\nPresident Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. “On the \nother hand,” he says, “I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the \nroom and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.”\n\nWhen he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the \ncabinet what he was planning.\n\n“I wanted to just think it through,” Mr. Bush remembers. “Any time you \ncommit troops to harm’s way, a president must make sure that he fully \nunderstands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just \nspend some time on it alone. And did.”\n\nWhat were his reservations?\n\nMr. Bush says, “Could we win? I didn’t want to be putting our troops in \nthere unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.”\n\nNine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of \nCongress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.\n\n“Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it \nhappened,” Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. “We’ll remember \nthe moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some \nwill remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry \nmemories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It \nis the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World \nTrade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, \nArlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that \nended and a task that does not end.”\n\nA year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to \nremind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being \nwaged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, \nliterally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.\n\nIn his desk, the president says, “I have a classified document that \nmight have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about who’s \nout there, where they might be”\n\nAnd as the terrorists are captures or killed? “I might make a little \ncheck there, yeah,” Mr. Bush admits.\n\nBut there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list – \nOsama bin Laden.\n\n(CBS)\xa0A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the \npresident was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. \nHe had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, \non his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did \nnot expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, \nCBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, \nabout whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nScott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we \nstill don’t have Osama Bin Laden?\n\nPresident Bush: How do you know that? I don’t know whether Osama bin \nLaden is dead or alive. I don’t know that. He’s not leading a lot of \nparades. And he’s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he \nwas. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is — we’re slowly \nbut surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that \nhates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I \nalways knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old \ndays, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his \ntanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. \nWe’re after these people one at the time. They’re killers. Period.\n\nPelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or \nalive?\n\nMr. Bush: If he were dead, there’s somebody else to replace him. And we \nwould find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al \nQaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And \nat the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary \nso that people don’t feel like they’ve got to conduct terror to achieve \nobjectives.\n\nPelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? \nCertainly, we’ve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda \nhas been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have \ngotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.\n\nMr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their \nlife. But I understand war. We did everything we can to — everything we \ncould to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a \nmistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for \nwhich I’m extremely proud. No, — I don’t second guess things. It’s — \nthings never go perfect in a time of war.\n\nPelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?\n\nMr. Bush: I’m committed to regime change.\n\nPelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war \nin Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for \nexample. Even your father’s former national security advisor, Mr. \nScowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your \nestimation that they don’t understand about the Iraq question that you \ndo appreciate?\n\nMr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasn’t \nchanged. I get all kinds of advice. I’m listening to the advice. I \nappreciate the consultations. And we’ll consult with a lot of people but \nour policy hasn’t changed.\n\nPelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.\n\nMr. Bush: Yeah.\n\nPelley: I don’t think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same \ntime, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for \npolitical reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the \noil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy \nthat you’re considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United \nStates.\n\nMr. Bush: Hmm. Well, I’m working for peace in the Middle East. I’m the \nfirst president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly \ndeclared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with \nIsrael in peace. I’ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace \nthe Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror \nand believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. \nI\'ve also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that \nthey’ve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward \nit. We’re more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it \nas well. But all this business isn’t going to happen as long as a few \nare willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight \noff terror.\n\nPelley: Arafat has to go?\n\nMr. Bush: Either, he’s, he’s been a complete failure as far as I am \nconcerned. Utter disappointment.\n\nPelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.\n\nMr. Bush: Yeah…\n\nPelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your \nadministration’s decision to close certain deportation hearings. They \nsaid, quote, “A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to \nthe Constitution.” Where do you draw the line sir?\n\nMr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. \nBut we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, \nconfines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.\n\nPelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you \nas an idea that you’ve thought, “No, that’s too far. I don’t wanna go…"\n\nMr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the \nJustice Department. I think that Attorney General’s doing a fine job, by \nthe way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure \nthat they review decisions we make, I think that’s fine. I mean, that’s \ngood. It’s healthy. It’s part of America.\n\nPelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of \nfour freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want \nand freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from \nfear?\n\nMr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are \non alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us \nmore free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. \nWe’ve got more work to do.\n\nPelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?\n\nMr. Bush: I don’t think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their \ngovernment’s doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get \ninformation that relates directly a particular attack we’ll deal with \nit. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, we’ll alert \npeople. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny \nand run down leads. And the American people need to go about their \nlives. It seems like they are.\n\n\n'

It can read right through\nmisspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author\nabove suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.\n\nIf the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything\nlike the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the\nfirst letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is\nthat without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially\nmore difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be\nresolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far\nless important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  \n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n"

'\n\nAn old Indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A58173-2002Mar7&notFound=true\n\nSlaughter in the Name of God\nBy Salman Rushdie\nFriday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington Post\n\nThe defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child\'s burned and \nblackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the \nremains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder \nof children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily \nkillings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in \nNellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring \nvillage . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the \nhorrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi\'s assassination: \nThey bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in \nevidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in \nkerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or \nsmothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length \nof wood.\n\nI say "our" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves \nIndia deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is \npotentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India\'s \nstrengths, then India\'s sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? \nGood. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India \nundergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a \ndecade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed \nor disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men\'s \nunwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to \nreligion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to \nthe same sentiments as the nation in general.\n\nMeanwhile, India\'s political masters have been tut-tutting and offering \nthe usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. \n(It has escaped nobody\'s notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya \nJanata Party (BJP), or Indian People\'s Party, and the Hindu extremists \nof the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister \norganizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some \ninternational commentators, such as Britain\'s Independent newspaper, \nurge us to "beware excess pessimism."\n\nThe horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we\'re used \nto it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That\'s how life is, \nfolks. Most of the time India is the world\'s largest secular democracy; \nand if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we \nmustn\'t let that distort the picture.\n\nOf course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, \nwhen a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which \nthey claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu \nfanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some \nMuslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the \ntrain-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes \nof the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the \npartition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists\' hands.\n\nThe VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and \ninsufficient radicalism of India\'s BJP government. Prime Minister Atal \nBihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a \ncoalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP\'s \nmore extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. \nBut it isn\'t working anymore. In state elections across the country, the \nBJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP \nfirebrands. Why put up with the government\'s betrayal of their fascistic \nagenda when that betrayal doesn\'t even result in electoral success?\n\nThe electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark \nthat lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the \nsite of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that\'s where the Godhra dead \nwere coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, \ntragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee \nhas insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and \nwrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.\n\nThe distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India\'s \npresident, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP \nhard-liner) as well as the central government for doing "too little too \nlate." She pins the blame firmly on the "motivated, well-planned out and \nprovocative actions" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the \nNobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the \nviolence erupted, denounced India\'s Muslims en masse and praised the \nnationalist movement.\n\nThe murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in \nher letter demands "stern legal action" against them. But the VHP is \ndetermined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such \npublic pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting \nthem, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces \nthe Nobel award.\n\nThe political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there\'s \nsomething beneath it, something we don\'t want to look in the face: \nnamely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is \nthe poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no \nexcuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in \nthe fashionable language of "respect." What is there to respect in any \nof this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around \nthe world in religion\'s dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, \nreligion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And \nwhen we\'ve done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results \nmakes it easier to do it again.\n\nSo India\'s problem turns out to be the world\'s problem. What happened in \nIndia has happened in God\'s name. The problem\'s name is God.\n\nSalman Rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay \ncollection "Step Across This Line."\n\n© 2002 The Washington Post Company\n\n\nsdw\n\n-- \nsdw@lig.net http://sdw.st\nStephen D.

"\n\nFirst, it was my understanding that they had the food before they\nrefused to pay.

Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.\n>\nA)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? \n Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.\nB) "How it is currently being expressed" amounts to a tacit \nacknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and \npeople\'s self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive \nexpression.  This leads to the point that religion and less \nsophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke \nthe image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of \nsociety.\nC) Many splinter Christianity religions have \'clean hands\' but they also \naren\'t \'found in the wild\'.\n\n(By "primitive expression", I don\'t mean to slight any society, but that \nthere is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized \nbehavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). \n The US has only really been mostly free of "primitive expression" for \n40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious \nconflict, were settled quite a while ago.)\n\nD) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or \nless concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated \nby splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article \npointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical \nintegration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, \ngovernment, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage \nof British conquest, but who doesn\'t?)\n\n(I couldn\'t find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true\n\n\'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and \ncloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and \nreligiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, \nand most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part \nof Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or \nnationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.\n\n\nIn 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the \nRev. Martin Luther King Jr.\'s campaign in the American South. But \nviolence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling \nthe political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both \nsides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by \nfar was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united \nIreland\n\nThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were \nkilled during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern \nIreland understatement, as "The Troubles."\'\n\n>2.

Of course, \'sophisticated\' and \'Western\nCivilization\' are essentially equivalent IMHO.

Hindu extremism isn\'t about the Hindu\nreligious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic\nidentity and identity politics on.\n\nMuslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.\n\n> \'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and\n> cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and\n> religiously divided.

It occurs at the very end\nof an excellent article which I recommend to you.\n\nIn the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been\nlistening to an heroic sermon about "the glory to be won in battle by young\npatriots armed with the love of God." He usurps the pulpit and prays the\nfollowing:\n\n"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our\nshells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their\npatriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of\ntheir wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with\na hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows\nwith unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little\nchildren to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and\nhunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of\nwinter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of\nthe grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their\nhopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their\nsteps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood\nof their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the\nSource of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that\nare sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen."\n\nTwain wrote the story, "The War Prayer," in 1905 during the American\noccupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn\'t printed until 1923,\nthirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it "unsuitable"\nfor publication at the time it was written.\n\n#  distributed via <nettime>: no commercial use without permission\n#  <nettime> is a moderated mailing list for net criticism,\n#  collaborative text filtering and cultural politics of the nets\n#  more info: majordomo@bbs.thing.net and "info nettime-l" in the msg body\n#  archive: http://www.nettime.org contact: nettime@bbs.thing.net\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and\nencryption to every\nMagi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow\nbetween workgroups within and\nbeyond the enterprise.\n\nSecure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly\nnetwork infrastructures. This\ncombination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific\nsecurity tools for each desktop\napplication such as Microsoft Project. With Magi\'s secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration\ncan now be rapidly, easily and\nsecurely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,\npartners and clients without concern\nin compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact\nhighly securely with strong\nencryption and authentication across firewalls.\n\n"In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge," says\nBernard Hulme, chairman and\nCEO of Endeavors Technology. "Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT\nmanagers with added\nassurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric\npeer-to-peer computing"\n\nEndeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete\ninteroperability between\npartner products and RSA Security\'s solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSA\nClearTrust® Web access\nmanagement, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management.\n\nThe strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging\nand advertising, be listed in\nRSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security\'s out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.\nIt will also lead to joint\nmarketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on\njoint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide\nbusiness continuity support.\n\n"Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise\nproducts and streamlining the\ndeployment process for IT managers," says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. "By\ncombining our products,\nenterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."\n\nAbout Magi\nMagi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today\'s Web into a highly secure\ninter- and intra-enterprise\ncollaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for\ncollaboration very rapidly and\naffordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this\nby effectively transforming\nunsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through\nthe use of such features as\ncross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name\nspaces generating "follow me URLs"\nfor mobile professionals.\n\nAbout RSA Security, Inc.\nRSA Security Inc., the most trusted name in e-security, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations\nfor e-business through its RSA\nSecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon\ndigital certificate\nmanagement product families.

You see it over and over again in\nhistory:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior\nAnthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became\nJunior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you\nknow it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive\nPeople are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is\nsubstantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the\nfacts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction\nthat is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American\nIndians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth\nin popular culture.\n\nI\'m far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where\nyou are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you\nhave a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal\npopulation, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n'

In order for the\ntwo flows to balance, the higher\npacket must contain less air than\nthe lower, and the mass balance\nof the flows corresponds thusly:\n\n    high percentage of thin air\n    ---------------------------\n    low percentage of dense air\n\nNow, rates are exponential in\nenergy differences[1], so that\ntheoretically we should expect\nan exponential decay in height,\nto compensate.

'\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nI know it\'s not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I\'d\nsuggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is\nshowing up, right?\n\n\nAlmost anyone can find a church where the sermons don\'t make you bust\nout laughing, and you\'re set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,\nas someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a\nreal church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70\'s bumper-sticker:\n"Honk if you\'re not sure"; Lenny Bruce: "Did you hear about how the\nKlan burned a question mark on the Unitarian\'s lawn?"; "Unitarians\nwould rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven\nitself."; "Unitarians pray \'to whom it may concern\'"; etc...)\n\nBut, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I\'m, um,\nlapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and\nan agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe\nor another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist\ncongregation is about as orthogonal to my present\ncongenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist\npolitics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist\nbit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I\nused to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.\nI\'m asymptotically approaching my father\'s atheism, these days, and I\nshow up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a\ncivil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can\'t and end up arguing\nwith them. :-).\n\n\nAnyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.\nI met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one\nyear after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married\nher 2 years after that, and I wasn\'t even trying meet women. I was\njust looking to make friends as I was new in town.\n\n\nThe trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation\nyou end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some\nguys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don\'t. You can\npractically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a\nroom...\n\nThat\'s because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most\nregular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in\nprotestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,\nlooks, intelligence, whatever, you\'ll end up surrounded by women.\nYou\'ll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at\nleast better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there\nare *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics\n- -- but I won\'t go there, I promise.\n\n\nIf I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure\nthat between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent\'s\nreligions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of\nassimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near\nyou, Rohit. You probably don\'t even have to go, um, native, like I\ndid -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing\nand becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPYjCBcPxH8jf3ohaEQI2vwCbB2UkMyii/XwKQvvJFSWlMMRheBsAmwUB\njDmfQrNRQED3LmW6V8YutN54\n=vQ/A\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave\'s attempt to fool you into thinking they\'re\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\n\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\nway.\n\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\n\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\n\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public\'s\nperception of them?  If you haven\'t already, contact them and ask them how\nthey feel about this foolishness.\n\n\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\nDave deflects what he can\'t take the time to understand\n\n\nIt\'s really quite pitiful.  When normal people don\'t understand something\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\nand looking like fools.\n\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\n\nPosts a link to something he doesn\'t understand\nGet\'s a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\nDerides the idea as being \'too much trouble\' and blogs it.\nExpects others to do research for him\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\nRealizes he\'s been a fool but refuses to correct himself\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it\'s use of RDF reveal this to be\ntrue.  Dave doesn\'t get the idea of the semantic web.  He\'d rather have you\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\ntrying.\n\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  "It\'s like that movie The\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave\'s like the purser ranting and raving that the\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don\'t know about\nyou but I\'d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\nThe ship\'s fucking sinking and I don\'t want to be following the idiot."\n\nDave\'s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\naround.  You\'re supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\ngood ol\' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It\'s all about love, right?  To hell\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you\'re the one causing\nall the trouble.\n\nWe\'ve news for you Dave, we\'re wise to your tactics and we\'re talking\namongst ourselves about it.  We\'re routing around you damaging behavoir.\nThat\'s where we\'re coming from.\n\nIf you have an example of how you\'ve tried to help Dave, please drop us an\ne-mail about it.  We\'ll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\n\n\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\n\n\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\n\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it\'s fundamentally\nimpossible:\n\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\n\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\npeople at other tables start whispering "that guy is an idiot..."\n\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you\'ve got a similar\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\n\n\n\n\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\n\n\nIt would appear the \'dictator release\' strategy that Dave\'s been trying on\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\n\nI\'m going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\ndeal-stoppers.\n\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\nit!\n\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They\'re going to be\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\n\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\ngetting rejected!\n\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\n\'blame America\' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he\'s trying to pretend we should be\nnice to him because he\'s still recovering?\n\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\nfights.  We\'ll still kick your ass regardless.  That\'s what years of your\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\n\n\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nDave is Scary on 9/11\n\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\n\n\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\nI\'ll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\nUserLand.

We sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search.\n\n\n 9/5/02; 12:15:07 PM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nLuserland Attempts to Trademark "RSS"\n\n\nDave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any\nBigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally\nbankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.\n\nSo we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried\nto patent the term \'RSS\' back in 2000. Here\'s the patent application:\n\nhttp://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336\n\nThis was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development\nefforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS\n1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.\n\nCould Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!\n\nSince when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others\nto do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:\n\nTim O\'Reilly says patents are OK, he\'s just against stupid patents. In the\nspirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.\nThere\'s no way to route around them.\n\n 9/4/02; 6:06:51 AM - Discuss\n\n\n\n\nWhen\'s a Permalink not a Permalink?\n\n\nWhen Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to\nnothing at that point. So apparently the "perma-" part in permalink is\npermanent. For everyone except Dave.

The alternative is a \nstate-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them \nnews.\n\nThe question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other \nspecific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the \n"publisher" (if any) decides or the "community" (if any) negotiates or does \nas a matter of custom.\n\nFor my part, I\'d rather people didn\'t use FoRK as a place in which to dump an \nexpression of their political beliefs.\n\nTom\n\n\n'

By integrating the advanced\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\' secure P2P\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\n\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\n\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\n  essential.\n\n  Endeavors\' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\n  sharing information directly from people\'s desktops. WebEx meetings can be\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\n\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\n  "present." This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\n  other people\'s Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\n\n  "In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries," says\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole\'s group chief executive. "The powerful combination\n  of Endeavors\' Magi and WebEx\'s communications technologies will assist\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings."\n\n  "WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\n  training, support and product design," says David Farrington, vice president\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. "By integrating the\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\' secure\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications."\n\n  About Magi\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\n  today\'s Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\n  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can\n  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and\n  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work\n  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming\n  unsecured, "read-only" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent\n  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as\n  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical\n  interface, and universal name spaces generating "follow me URLs" for mobile\n  professionals.\n\n  About Endeavors Technology, Inc.\n  Endeavors Technology, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of mobile computing\n  and network infrastructure vendor Tadpole Technology plc (LSE-TAD,\n  www.tadpole.com), which has plants and offices in Irvine and Carlsbad\n  (California), and Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Bristol (UK).

No dumping tea in the \nharbour or anything like that.\nI think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on \ntelevision, and that the tactics can be\njustified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative \nviewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,\nit was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and \nthe protestors were not in anybody\'s face\n(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).\n\nAnd no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence \npoliticians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and\nwriting checks is beyond many of us.\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

The transitive sense of\n"shiver", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the\n1800s (web1913 doesn\'t even list it as archaic or obsolete), means\n"to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow".\n\nShivering a boat\'s timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.\n(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,\nleaves you with a sinking boat.)\n\nSo, "Shiver my timbers if I do," can be reasonably interpreted as a more\nvivid way of saying, "May I die suddenly if I do."

'\n\nWell, it looks like Sun are going ahead with\ntheir ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril. \n\nGreg\n\nReuters Market News\n  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks \n  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET \n  By Peter Henderson \n\n  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday\n  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as\n  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.\n\n  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld\n  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals\n  making computers which manage networks. \n  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage\n  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for\n  broader management. International Business Machines Corp\'s project eLiza is working\n  to make computers "self-healing" when systems break.\n\n  "Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the\n  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don\'t think about what box\n  it is running on," Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an\n  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. \n\n  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or\n  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever\n  needed. \n  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling\n  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are\n  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from\n  different vendors to interoperate closely. \n  Sun promised to deliver a "virtualization engine" that would let administrators look at\n  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today\n  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. \n\n  "It\'ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out," promised MacKay\n  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as\n  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. \n  Finally, in 2004, Sun\'s software should allow networks to change uses of resources on\n  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response\n  time for priority users, the company said.\n\n\n'

That\'s wrong,\nimmoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and\nthe protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or\nsome of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to\nget attention is fine.\n\n> That picture\n> will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and\n> France, at least.

Was he just jacking himself\noff at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were\nnot arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing\nabout your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police\narresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That\nattitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what\nyou believe.\n\n> It is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on\n> the nightly\n> news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.\n\nSure, just don\'t whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get\nin someone\'s face.\n\nOne other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking\nout the Iraqi dictator wouldn\'t give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.\nThey simply wouldn\'t care so why in the hell should the Americal public\nlisten to them on matters of national security?\n\nSo enlighten me, exactly why shouldn\'t Hussein be taken out? And if your\nanswr boils down to "i don\'t give a shit about what happens to the US", you\ncan kiss my ass :-)\n\nBill\n\n\n'

'\n\n> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human \n> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.\n\nAbsolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about \nlife on Earth today.\n\nThe following is a fascinating document of official Government policy \nthat bears close reading.

And it\'s even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and \ntaking share from every other government broadcaster.\n\nIt is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term \nas it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.\n\nMany of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly \ncentrist.

The document, entitled "The National Security Strategy of the \nUnited States," will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of \nthe Administration\'s policy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and \ntotalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of \nfreedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, \ndemocracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only \nnations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and \nguaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the \npotential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People \neverywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; \nworship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own \nproperty; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom \nare right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of \nprotecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of \nfreedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n\nToday, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military \nstrength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our \nheritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for \nunilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that \nfavors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies \ncan choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and \neconomic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the \nworld to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace \nagainst threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace \nby building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the \npeace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n\nDefending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental \ncommitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed \ndramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great \nindustrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of \nindividuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less \nthan it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to \npenetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies \nagainst us.\n\nTo defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- \nfrom better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and \ncutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global \nreach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help \nnations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will \nhold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the \nallies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and \ncountries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop \nnew home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every \nturn.\n\nThe gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism \nand technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking \nweapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing \nso with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to \nsucceed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other \nmeans of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, \ncontain, and curtail our enemies\' efforts to acquire dangerous \ntechnologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America \nwill act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We \ncannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must \nbe prepared to defeat our enemies\' plans, using the best intelligence \nand proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who \nsaw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have \nentered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n\nAs we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic \nopportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community \nhas the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the \nseventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace \ninstead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world\'s great powers \nfind ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist \nviolence and chaos. The United States will build on these common \ninterests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by \ncommon values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching \nfor its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese \nleaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of \nnational wealth. In time, they will find that social and political \nfreedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage \nthe advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, \nbecause these are the best foundations for domestic stability and \ninternational order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great \npowers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, \ntrade, and cultural advancement.\n\nFinally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend \nthe benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring \nthe hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to \nevery corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us \nthat weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our \nnational interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people \ninto terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and \ncorruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and \ndrug cartels within their borders.\n\nThe United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a \nbetter future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free \ntrade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies \nout of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual \nnations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to \nbuild a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. \nThe United States will deliver greater development assistance through \nthe New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, \ninvest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also \ncontinue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of \nAIDS and other infectious diseases.\n\nIn building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is \nguided by the conviction that all nations have important \nresponsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. \nNations that depend on international stability must help prevent the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international \naid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For \nfreedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n\nWe are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, \nbetter world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply \nthe strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed \nto lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade \nOrganization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as \nother long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment \nthese permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations \nare to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to \nrally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n\nFreedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of \nevery person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has \nbeen threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the \nclashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and \nit has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity \nholds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom\'s triumph over all \nthese foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in \nthis great mission.\n\nI. Overview of America\'s International Strategy\n\n\n"Our Nation\'s cause has always been larger than our Nation\'s defense. We \nfight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors \nliberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists \nand tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among \nthe great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and \nopen societies on every continent."\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength \nand influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of \nliberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with \nunparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great \nstrength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that \nfavors freedom.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great \nstruggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and \nequality.\n\nThat great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and \nrace which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and \ndiscredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we \nare by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by \ncatastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must \ndefeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n\nThis is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to \ntranslate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, \nand liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a \ndistinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our \nvalues and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help \nmake the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to \nprogress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations \nwith other states, and respect for human dignity.\n\nAnd this path is not America\'s alone. It is open to all.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the United States will:\n\n*\tchampion aspirations for human dignity;\n\n*\tstrengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent \nattacks against us and our friends;\n\n*\twork with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n\n*\tprevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our \nfriends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n\n*\tignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and \nfree trade;\n\n*\texpand the circle of development by opening societies and building \nthe infrastructure of democracy;\n\n*\tdevelop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of \nglobal power; and\n\n*\ttransform America\'s national security institutions to meet the \nchallenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n\n\nII. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n\n\n"Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the \nlanguage of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require \ndifferent methods, but not different moralities."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nIn pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we \nstand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because \nthese principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation \nowns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and \nmothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live \nfree from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be \noppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of \nthe secret police.\n\nAmerica must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human \ndignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; \nfree speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; \nreligious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n\nThese demands can be met in many ways. America\'s constitution has served \nus well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, \nfacing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these \ncore principles into their own systems of governance. History has not \nbeen kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and \naspirations of their people.\n\nOur own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in \nour worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of \nIndependence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a \nstronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n\nToday, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And \nwhen openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central \nand eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When \nwe see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in \nthe Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin \nAmerica and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can \nevolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all \ncherish.\n\nEmbodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, \nthe national security strategy of the United States must start from \nthese core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n\nOur principles will guide our government\'s decisions about international \ncooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation \nof resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international \nbodies.\n\nWe will:\n\n*\tspeak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of \nhuman dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to \nadvance freedom;\n\n*\tuse our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who \nstruggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward \ndemocracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n\n*\tmake freedom and the development of democratic institutions key \nthemes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation \nfrom other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights \nto move toward a better future; and\n\n*\ttake special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience \nand defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n\n\nWe will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist \nit.\n\nIII. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent \nAttacks Against Us and Our Friends\n\n\n"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have \nthe distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already \nclear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been \nwaged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is \npeaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on \nthe timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of \nour choosing."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\nSeptember 14, 2001\n\n\n\nThe United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of \nglobal reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or \nreligion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, \npolitically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n\nIn many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a \nlasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed \nwithin a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United \nStates will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals \nwith them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who \nknowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n\nThe struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in \nour history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly \nelusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come \nthrough the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some \nunseen.\n\nToday our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, \nand will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to \nachieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition \nforces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not \nonly this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of \ntrained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South \nAmerica, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n\nOur priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist \norganizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, \ncontrol, and communications; material support; and finances. This will \nhave a disabling effect upon the terrorists\' ability to plan and operate.\n\nWe will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a \ncoordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional \ncampaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure \nthe state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial \ntools necessary to finish the task.\n\nThe United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the \nfinancing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of \nfunding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who \nsupport them, deny terrorists access to the international financial \nsystem, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, \nand prevent the movement of terrorists\' assets through alternative \nfinancial networks.\n\nHowever, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the \ncumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we \nseek.\n\nWe will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n\n*\tdirect and continuous action using all the elements of national and \ninternational power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist \norganizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of \nterrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction \n(WMD) or their precursors;\n\n*\tdefending the United States, the American people, and our interests \nat home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it \nreaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to \nenlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate \nto act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by \nacting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing \nharm against our people and our country; and\n\n*\tdenying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists \nby convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign \nresponsibilities.\n\n\nWe will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international \nterrorism. This includes:\n\n*\tusing the full influence of the United States, and working closely \nwith allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are \nillegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as \nslavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government \ncan condone or support and all must oppose;\n\n*\tsupporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim \nworld, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote \nterrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n\n*\tdiminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by \nenlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources \non areas most at risk; and\n\n*\tusing effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of \ninformation and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of \nthose in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n\n\nWhile we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also \nstrengthening America\'s homeland security to protect against and deter \nattack.\n\nThis Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization \nsince the Truman Administration created the National Security Council \nand the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity and including a new unified military command and a fundamental \nreordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland \nencompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public \nand the private sector.\n\nThis strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, \nemergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with \nterrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened \nto manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and \nmass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop \nterrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n\nWhile our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism \nin today\'s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. \nWherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations \nand state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where \ngovernments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we \nwill match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and \nour allies can provide.\n\nAs we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work \nwith international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as \nnon-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the \nhumanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to \nrebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, \nthreaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n\nIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are \nultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom \nand fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this \nconflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, \nproductive international relationships and redefining existing ones in \nways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n\nIV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts\n\n\n"We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. \nThe magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements \nlook so small."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nBerlin, Germany\nMay 23, 2002\n\n\n\nConcerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional \ndisputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In \nan increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our \nalliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create \nhorrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states \nfalter, the United States will work with friends and partners to \nalleviate suffering and restore stability.\n\nNo doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- \ndirect or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, \nand military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States \nwill approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n\n*\tThe United States should invest time and resources into building \ninternational relationships and institutions that can help manage local \ncrises when they emerge.\n\n*\tThe United States should be realistic about its ability to help \nthose who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when \npeople are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n\n\nPolicies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will \napply these principles:\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of \nhuman suffering, because of America\'s close relationship with the state \nof Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region\'s importance \nto other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace \nfor either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed \nto an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in \npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a \ngovernment that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and \ncounts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all \nparties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and \ncomprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n\nThe United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank \nstand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic \ndevelopment, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to \nestablish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If \nPalestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront \ncorruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support \nfor the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. \nPermanent occupation threatens Israel\'s identity and democracy. So the \nUnited States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete \nsteps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. \nAs there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw \nfully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent \nwith the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement \nactivity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, \nfreedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians \nto resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial \nrole but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and \nPalestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n\nIn South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India \nand Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested \ntime and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and \nPakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a \nconstructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With \nPakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan\'s \nchoice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more \nopen and tolerant society. The Administration sees India\'s potential to \nbecome one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century \nand has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our \ninvolvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in \nbilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan \nthat can help defuse military confrontation.\n\nIndonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and \nrespect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting \nthe rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to \nemploy the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its \nneighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by \nIndonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with \ncountries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, \nCanada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic \nhemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, \nopportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as \nthe Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States \n(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of \nthe entire hemisphere.\n\nParts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising \nfrom the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict \nand unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and \nsecurity of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active \nstrategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce \ntheir laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of \ndrugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs \nin our own country.\n\nIn Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist \ngroups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking \nactivities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are \nworking to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat \nillegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective \nsovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic \nsecurity to the Colombian people.\n\nIn Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, \nand desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United \nStates -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- \ncombating global terror. American interests and American principles, \ntherefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an \nAfrican continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. \nTogether with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa\'s \nfragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous \nborders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence \ninfrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n\nAn ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars \nspread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions \nof the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to \nconfronting these emerging transnational threats.\n\nAfrica\'s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that \nfocuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This \nadministration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the \nregion:\n\n*\tcountries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South \nAfrica, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement \nand require focused attention;\n\n*\tcoordination with European allies and international institutions is \nessential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace \noperations; and\n\n*\tAfrica\'s capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations \nmust be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational \nthreats on a sustained basis.\n\n\nUltimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the \nsurest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are \nconflicts over material resources and political access often tragically \nwaged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to \nthe African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a \ncommon responsibility for democratic political systems offers \nopportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n\nV. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends \nwith Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n\n"The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and \ntechnology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear \nweapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, \neven weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to \nstrike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and \nhave been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the \ncapability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and \nwe will oppose them with all our power."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nThe nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our \nallies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy\'s use of \nforce, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security \nenvironment has undergone profound transformation.\n\nHaving moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our \nrelationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the \nbalance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear \narsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as \ncounterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were \ninconceivable.\n\nBut new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. \nNone of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power \nthat was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and \nmotivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain \ndestructive powers hitherto available only to the world\'s strongest \nstates, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass \ndestruction against us, make today\'s security environment more complex \nand dangerous.\n\nIn the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue \nstates that, while different in important ways, share a number of \nattributes. These states:\n\n*\tbrutalize their own people and squander their national resources \nfor the personal gain of the rulers;\n\n*\tdisplay no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, \nand callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n\n*\tare determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with \nother advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively \nto achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n\n*\tsponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n\n*\treject basic human values and hate the United States and everything \nfor which it stands.\n\n\nAt the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq\'s \ndesigns were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against \nIran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear \nweapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become \nthe world\'s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested \nincreasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. \nOther rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as \nwell. These states\' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has \nbecome a looming threat to all nations.\n\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients \nbefore they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must \ntake full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new \npartnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military \nforces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective \nmissile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence \ncollection and analysis.\n\nOur comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n\n*\tProactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend \nagainst the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key \ncapabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce \ncapabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our \nhomeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated \ninto the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of \nour allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed \nadversaries.\n\n*\tStrengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and \nterrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise \nnecessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, \narms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction \nassistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when \nnecessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will \ncontinue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their \nincreased political and financial support for nonproliferation and \nthreat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 \nbillion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step \nforward.\n\n*\tEffective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD \nuse, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of \nWMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such \nweapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading \nenemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States \nmust also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our \nforces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n\n\nIt has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of \nthis new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the \nUnited States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have \nin the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy \nof today\'s threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be \ncaused by our adversaries\' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. \nWe cannot let our enemies strike first.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we \nfaced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an \neffective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of \nretaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states \nmore willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and \nthe wealth of their nations.\n\n*\tIn the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered \nweapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who \nused them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons \nof choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and \nmilitary aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also \nallow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our \nallies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior \nof rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means \nof overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n\n*\tTraditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a \nterrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the \ntargeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death \nand whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between \nstates that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to \naction.\n\n\nFor centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer \nan attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves \nagainst forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars \nand international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption \non the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible \nmobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and \nobjectives of today\'s adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not \nseek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would \nfail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use \nof weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed \nand delivered covertly and without warning.\n\nThe targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian \npopulation, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law \nof warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, \nmass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and \nthese losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired \nand used weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions \nto counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the \nthreat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling \nthe case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if \nuncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\'s attack. To \nforestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United \nStates will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n\nThe United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging \nthreats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. \nYet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek \nthe world\'s most destructive technologies, the United States cannot \nremain idle while dangers gather.\n\nWe will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our \nactions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n\n*\tbuild better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide \ntimely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n\n*\tcoordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the \nmost dangerous threats; and\n\n*\tcontinue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to \nconduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n\n\nThe purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat \nto the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our \nactions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n\nVI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and \nFree Trade.\n\n\n"When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a \nprivileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever \nenough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in \nbetter health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade \nrevenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nMonterrey, Mexico\nMarch 22, 2002\n\n\n\nA strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing \nprosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth \nsupported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher \nincomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs \neconomic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it \nreinforces the habits of liberty.\n\nWe will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America\'s \nshores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic \npolicies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our \neconomic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of \npolicies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic \ngrowth, including:\n\n*\tpro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business \ninvestment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n\n*\ttax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that \nimprove incentives for work and investment;\n\n*\trule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are \nconfident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic \nendeavors;\n\n*\tstrong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most \nefficient use;\n\n*\tsound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n\n*\tinvestments in health and education that improve the well-being and \nskills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n\n*\tfree trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the \ndiffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and \nopportunity.\n\n\nThe lessons of history are clear: market economies, not \ncommand-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the \nbest way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further \nstrengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for \nall economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the \ndeveloping world.\n\nA return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. \nnational security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies \nfor their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake \nof global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in \ntheir economies are particularly important in this regard, as are \nJapan\'s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of \nnon-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to \nuse our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- \nincluding through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they \nare adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher \nglobal economic growth.\n\nImproving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic \ngrowth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand \nthe productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging \nmarkets and developing countries to make the investments that raise \nliving standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a \nworld in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that \nallow them access to international capital markets and to invest in \ntheir future.\n\nWe are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve \naccess to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will \ncontinue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial \nmarkets. We will work actively with other countries, the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action \nPlan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and \nmore effectively resolving them when they occur.\n\nThe best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from \noccurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing \nso. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy \nconditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on \nachieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, \nexchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n\nThe concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it \nbecame a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others \nvalue, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something \nthat you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the \nfreedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free \ntrade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n\n*\tSeize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we \nhelped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, \nespecially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for \ncompletion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the \naccession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade \nOrganization. We will assist Russia\'s preparations to join the WTO.\n\n*\tPress regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies \nin the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of \nthe Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United \nStates will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, \ntargeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and \ngovernment procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the \npoorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences \nallowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free \ntrade.\n\n*\tMove ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the \nfree trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration \nwill work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of \ndeveloped and developing countries in all regions of the world. \nInitially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will \nbe our principal focal points.\n\n*\tRenew the executive-congressional partnership. Every \nadministration\'s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with \nCongress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished \nmajority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing \nTrade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for \ndeveloping countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will \nwork with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade \nagreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade \nPromotion Authority.\n\n*\tPromote the connection between trade and development. Trade \npolicies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, \ncompetition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open \nsocieties, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional \nintegration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in \ndeveloping countries. The United States is implementing The Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods \nproduced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more \nuse of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue \nto work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer \ncountries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, \nthe most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public \nhealth. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are \nflexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical \nmedicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria.\n\n*\tEnforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. \nCommerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on \nenforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing \ndisputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a \nglobal effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations \nthat needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws \nagainst unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international \ncommunity must be able to address genuine concerns about government \nsubsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which \nundermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n\n*\tHelp domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound \nstatutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used \nin the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the \nAmerican steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the \nenforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that \nthe benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American \nworkers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the \nchange and dynamism of open markets.\n\n*\tProtect the environment and workers. The United States must foster \neconomic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with \nwidening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental \nconcerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network" \nbetween multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the \nInternational Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade \ntalks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n\n*\tEnhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security \nand the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our \nallies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and \ntypes of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, \nAfrica, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to \nwork with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient \ntechnologies.\n\n\nEconomic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize \ngreenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing \nthem at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the \nglobal climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America\'s greenhouse \ngas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such \nemissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 \nyears, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be \nto:\n\n*\tremain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for \ninternational cooperation;\n\n*\tobtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of \nthe most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to \ncompanies that can show real cuts;\n\n*\tdevelop improved standards for measuring and registering emission \nreductions;\n\n*\tpromote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as \nwell as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, \nwhile also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n\n*\tincrease spending on research and new conservation technologies, to \na total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change \nby any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year\'s \nbudget; and\n\n*\tassist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas \nemitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and \nresources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and \nbetter path.\n\n\nVII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building \nthe Infrastructure of Democracy\n\n\n"In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to \nrebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we \nmust also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank)\nMarch 14, 2002\n\n\n\nA world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human \nrace lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including \nall of the world\'s poor in an expanding circle of development -- and \nopportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of \nU.S. international policy.\n\nDecades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic \ngrowth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served \nto prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and \nperpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars \nspent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction \nachieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n\nWorking with other nations, the United States is confronting this \nfailure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing \nfor Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and \nthe strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n\nThis Administration\'s goal is to help unleash the productive potential \nof individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is \nimpossible without the right national policies. Where governments have \nimplemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels \nof assistance. The United States and other developed countries should \nset an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world\'s \npoorest economies within a decade.\n\nThe United States Government will pursue these major strategies to \nachieve this goal:\n\n*\tProvide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of \nnational reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core \ndevelopment assistance given by the United States. While continuing our \npresent programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, \nthese billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge \nAccount for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest \nin their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight \ncorruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest \nin health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and \nenable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward \ncountries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those \nthat have not to implement reforms.\n\n*\tImprove the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development \nbanks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a \ncomprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other \nmultilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of \nthe world\'s poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. \ncontributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. \ncontributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the \nWorld Bank\'s fund for the poorest countries -- and the African \nDevelopment Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing \npoverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially \nin the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral \ndevelopment banks to focus on activities that increase economic \nproductivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, \nand private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant \nmust be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in \ndeveloping countries.\n\n*\tInsist upon measurable results to ensure that development \nassistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world\'s \npoor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that \nmore children are getting a better education, more people have access to \nhealth care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a \nbetter future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure \nthe success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering \nresults. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own \ndevelopment assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral \ndevelopment banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for \nachieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nreplenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem that measures recipient countries\' progress. For the first time, \ndonors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the \nachievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. \ncontribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the \nWorld Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this \nprogress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything \nthat these institutions do.\n\n*\tIncrease the amount of development assistance that is provided in \nthe form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants \nis the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, \nparticularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with \never-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA \nagreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the \npoorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, \nsanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress \nby increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development \nbanks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private \nsector to match government efforts by using grants to support \ndevelopment projects that show results.\n\n*\tOpen societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are \nthe real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, \nmost money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and \nforeign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows \nas well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national \nsecurity strategy.\n\n*\tSecure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor \ncountries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics \nlike HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be \nthreatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the \ndeveloped world are necessary but will be effective only with honest \ngovernance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective \nlocal infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new \nglobal fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan \nand its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for \ntreatment and care. The United States already contributes more than \ntwice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the \nglobal fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n\n*\tEmphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of \ndemocracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources \nare devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States \nwill increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 \npercent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher \ntraining in Africa. The United States can also bring information \ntechnology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been \ndevastated by AIDS.\n\n*\tContinue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, \nincluding biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields \nin developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. \nUsing sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits \nto the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still \nsuffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n\n\nVIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers \nof Global Power\n\n\n"We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th \ncentury to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead \nof prepare for war."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWest Point, New York\nJune 1, 2002\n\n\n\nAmerica will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as \nbroad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance \nof power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires \nclear priorities, an appreciation of others\' interests, and consistent \nconsultations among partners with a spirit of humility.\n\nThere is little of lasting consequence that the United States can \naccomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies \nand friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the \nstrongest and most able international institutions in the world: the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its \ninception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European \nsecurity, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world \ntrade.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself \nrecognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the \nfirst time. NATO\'s core mission -- collective defense of the \ntransatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop \nnew structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new \ncircumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, \nhighly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to \nrespond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, \ncreating coalitions under NATO\'s own mandate, as well as contributing to \nmission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n\n*\texpand NATO\'s membership to those democratic nations willing and \nable to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n\n*\tensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate \ncombat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n\n*\tdevelop planning processes to enable those contributions to become \neffective multinational fighting forces;\n\n*\ttake advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of \nscale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that \nthey dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n\n*\tstreamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to \nmeet new operational demands and the associated requirements of \ntraining, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; \nand\n\n*\tmaintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as \nwe take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n\n\nIf NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a \npartnership as central to the security and interests of its member \nstates as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common \nperspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to \ntake common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the \nsame time, we welcome our European allies\' efforts to forge a greater \nforeign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to \nclose consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We \ncannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of \ntransatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n\nThe attacks of September 11 energized America\'s Asian alliances. \nAustralia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an \nattack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the \ndispatch of some of the world\'s finest combat forces for Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented \nlevels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist \nattack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our \nalliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received \ninvaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n\nThe war against terrorism has proven that America\'s alliances in Asia \nnot only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and \nready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and \nfriendships, we will:\n\n\n*\tlook to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and \nglobal affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our \nclose defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n\n*\twork with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while \npreparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of \nthe region over the longer-term;\n\n*\tbuild on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we \ncontinue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as \nwe have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n\n*\tmaintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our \nallies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic \nenvironment; and\n\n*\tbuild on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with \ninstitutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nforum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage \nchange in this dynamic region.\n\n\nWe are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power \ncompetition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of \ninternal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all \nthree cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly \nglobal consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n\nWith Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based \non a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and \nRussia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on \nStrategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a \ncritical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, \nlong-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United \nStates. Russia\'s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their \ncountry\'s current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- \nneeded to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that \nCold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that \nRussian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.\n\nUnited States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to \nrefocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and \nchallenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia\'s entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to \npromote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have \ncreated the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security \ncooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will \ncontinue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the \nformer Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable \nneighborhood will reinforce Russia\'s growing commitment to integration \ninto the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\nAt the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still \ndivide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to \nbuild an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our \nmotives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our \nrelations. Russia\'s uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market \ndemocracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia\'s very \nweakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those \nopportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even \ndecades.\n\nThe United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral \nrelationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests \nrequire a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest \ndemocracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We \nhave a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through \nthe vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest \nin fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.\n\nDifferences remain, including over the development of India\'s nuclear \nand missile programs, and the pace of India\'s economic reforms. But \nwhile in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about \nIndia, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with \nwhich we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership \nwith India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic \nfuture.\n\nThe United States relationship with China is an important part of our \nstrategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific \nregion. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous \nChina. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. \nYet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst \nfeatures of the Communist legacy, China\'s leaders have not yet made the \nnext series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. \nIn pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its \nneighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated \npath that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national \ngreatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is \nthe only source of that greatness.\n\nThe United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing \nChina. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including \nthe current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean \npeninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan \nand have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and \nsimilar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, \nsuch as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the \nwelfare of our citizens.\n\nAddressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become \nmore open with information, promote the development of civil society, \nand enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to \npolitical openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting \nvillage-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national \none-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly \naccountable to its citizen\'s needs and aspirations, however, much work \nremains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, \nassemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.\n\nOur important trade relationship will benefit from China\'s entry into \nthe World Trade Organization, which will create more export \nopportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, \nand companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over \n$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and \nthe WTO\'s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance \nopenness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic \nprotections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other \nareas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the \nself-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human \nrights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation \ncommitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but \nnot allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.\n\nThe events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for \nrelations between the United States and other main centers of global \npower, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies \nin Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we \nmust develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships \nbecome routine and unproductive.\n\nEvery agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We \ncan build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober \nanalysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices \nthat will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open \nthe path of progress.\n\nIX. Transform America\'s National Security Institutions to Meet the \nChallenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century\n\n\n"Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch \nits source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, \nand enterprise of our people."\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bush\nWashington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)\nSeptember 20, 2001\n\n\n\nThe major institutions of American national security were designed in a \ndifferent era to meet different requirements. All of them must be \ntransformed.\n\nIt is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. \nWe must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military\'s \nhighest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, \nour military must:\n\n*\tassure our allies and friends;\n\n*\tdissuade future military competition;\n\n*\tdeter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and\n\n*\tdecisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.\n\n\nThe unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their \nforward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world\'s most \nstrategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must \nconfront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to \ndeter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on \nhow an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might \noccur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational \nchallenges.\n\nThe presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound \nsymbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our \nwillingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, \nthe United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of \npower that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the \nmany security challenges we face, the United States will require bases \nand stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as \nwell as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment \nof U.S. forces.\n\nBefore the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major \nplanning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate \nacross the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch \nof the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by \ndeveloping assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision \nstrike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. \nThis broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the \nability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure \nU.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. \ninfrastructure and assets in outer space.\n\nInnovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new \napproaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. \nintelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and \ntechnology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is \nrun, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. \nFinally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight \nthe war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a \nwider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of \ncoercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.\n\nWe know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from \nexperience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must \nand will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- \nwhether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United \nStates, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces \nsufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces \nwill be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a \nmilitary build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the \nUnited States.\n\nIntelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense \nagainst terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed \naround the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, \nfixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping \nwith the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of \ntargets.\n\nWe must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to \nkeep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be \nappropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems \nand coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the \ncapabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the \nknowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek \nthe benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and \nto maximize injury.\n\nWe must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide \nintegrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since \nthe threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted \ninside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of \ninformation between intelligence and law enforcement.\n\nInitiatives in this area will include:\n\n*\tstrengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence \nto lead the development and actions of the Nation\'s foreign intelligence \ncapabilities;\n\n*\testablishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides \nseamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing \nthe nation and our allies;\n\n*\tcontinuing to develop new methods of collecting information to \nsustain our intelligence advantage;\n\n*\tinvesting in future capabilities while working to protect them \nthrough a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence \ncapabilities; and\n\n*\tcollecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the \ngovernment with all-source analysis.\n\n\nAs the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend \nAmerica\'s interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other \nnations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding \nsufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State \nDepartment takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with \nother governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must \nbe able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations \nand international institutions. Officials trained mainly in \ninternational politics must also extend their reach to understand \ncomplex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public \nhealth, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.\n\nOur diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil \nwars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief \nrequirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build \npolice forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial \ngovernment institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international \ncooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American \nreadiness to play our part.\n\nJust as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out \nto others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to \npublic information efforts that can help people around the world learn \nabout and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of \ncivilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, \na battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas \nand this is an area where America must excel.\n\nWe will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet \nour global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired \nby the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend \nto Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with \nother nations to avoid complications in our military operations and \ncooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral \nagreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will \nimplement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose \nprovisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. \npersonnel and officials.\n\nWe will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the \nright level and allocation of government spending on national security. \nThe United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this \nwar. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for \nthe American people.\n\nToday, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is \ndiminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\'s borders have \na greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, \nand goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- \nour freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are \nvulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we \nbring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. \nAs time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that \nuntil now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This \nis a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite \nof it.\n\nIn exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and \ninterests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act \napart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we \ndisagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for \nour concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow \nsuch disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with \nour allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.\n\nUltimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the \nskills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of \nour institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, \nentrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that \nenergy. That is where our national security begins.\n\n\n'

'\n\nGary Lawrence Murphy:\n>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)\n\nSince it was my quip, I\'ll point out that I used\nthe term "alcoholism," implying addiction. I\ndrink. I\'m not an alcoholic. Most people who drink\ndon\'t go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA\nmeetings do (try very hard) not to drink.\n\nAs to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in\nalmost any degree. Were I single, I might consider\npotential mates who partook of the less irrational\nor more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or\nBuddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan\nof the second. But someone who is both irrational\nand serious about that irrationality strikes me as\na bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who\nwas addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug\naddicts at least have the sense to battle their\nproblem, and to keep their children from suffering\nit. The religious revel in their irrationality,\nand want to raise their children in it. That\'s a\ndifficult difference for two parents to\nreconcile.\n\nFortunately, I am long and happily enamored of\nsomeone who has no religious tendencies.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\n\n\n'

The document, entitled "The National Security Strategy of the\n> United States," will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of\n> the Administration\'s policy.\n>\n> INTRODUCTION\n>\n> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of\n> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\n> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n>\n> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n>\n> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n> against us.\n>\n> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n> turn.\n>\n> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\n> contain, and curtail our enemies\' efforts to acquire dangerous\n> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\n> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n> be prepared to defeat our enemies\' plans, using the best intelligence\n> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\n> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\n> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n>\n> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\n> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\n> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\n> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\n> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world\'s great powers\n> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\n> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\n> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\n> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\n> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\n> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\n> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\n> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\n> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\n> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\n> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\n> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\n> trade, and cultural advancement.\n>\n> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\n> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\n> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\n> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\n> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\n> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\n> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\n> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\n> drug cartels within their borders.\n>\n> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\n> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\n> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\n> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\n> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\n> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\n> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\n> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\n> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\n> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\n> AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n>\n> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\n> guided by the conviction that all nations have important\n> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\n> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\n> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\n> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\n> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n>\n> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\n> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\n> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\n> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\n> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\n> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\n> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\n> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\n> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n>\n> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\n> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\n> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\n> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\n> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\n> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom\'s triumph over all\n> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\n> this great mission.\n>\n> I. Overview of America\'s International Strategy\n>\n>\n> "Our Nation\'s cause has always been larger than our Nation\'s defense. We\n> fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors\n> liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists\n> and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among\n> the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and\n> open societies on every continent."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength\n> and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of\n> liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with\n> unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great\n> strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that\n> favors freedom.\n>\n> For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great\n> struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and\n> equality.\n>\n> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\n> race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and\n> discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we\n> are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by\n> catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must\n> defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.\n>\n> This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to\n> translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,\n> and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a\n> distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our\n> values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help\n> make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to\n> progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations\n> with other states, and respect for human dignity.\n>\n> And this path is not America\'s alone. It is open to all.\n>\n> To achieve these goals, the United States will:\n>\n> * champion aspirations for human dignity;\n>\n> * strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent\n> attacks against us and our friends;\n>\n> * work with others to defuse regional conflicts;\n>\n> * prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our\n> friends, with weapons of mass destruction;\n>\n> * ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and\n> free trade;\n>\n> * expand the circle of development by opening societies and building\n> the infrastructure of democracy;\n>\n> * develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of\n> global power; and\n>\n> * transform America\'s national security institutions to meet the\n> challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.\n>\n>\n> II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity\n>\n>\n> "Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the\n> language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require\n> different methods, but not different moralities."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we\n> stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because\n> these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation\n> owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and\n> mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live\n> free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be\n> oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of\n> the secret police.\n>\n> America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human\n> dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;\n> free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;\n> religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.\n>\n> These demands can be met in many ways. America\'s constitution has served\n> us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,\n> facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these\n> core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not\n> been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and\n> aspirations of their people.\n>\n> Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in\n> our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of\n> Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a\n> stronger, but is a freer and more just society.\n>\n> Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And\n> when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central\n> and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When\n> we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in\n> the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin\n> America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can\n> evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all\n> cherish.\n>\n> Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,\n> the national security strategy of the United States must start from\n> these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.\n>\n> Our principles will guide our government\'s decisions about international\n> cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation\n> of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international\n> bodies.\n>\n> We will:\n>\n> * speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of\n> human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to\n> advance freedom;\n>\n> * use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who\n> struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward\n> democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;\n>\n> * make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key\n> themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation\n> from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights\n> to move toward a better future; and\n>\n> * take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience\n> and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.\n>\n>\n> We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist\n> it.\n>\n> III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent\n> Attacks Against Us and Our Friends\n>\n>\n> "Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have\n> the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already\n> clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been\n> waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is\n> peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on\n> the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of\n> our choosing."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)\n> September 14, 2001\n>\n>\n>\n> The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of\n> global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or\n> religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,\n> politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.\n>\n> In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a\n> lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed\n> within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United\n> States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals\n> with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who\n> knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.\n>\n> The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in\n> our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly\n> elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come\n> through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some\n> unseen.\n>\n> Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,\n> and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to\n> achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition\n> forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not\n> only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of\n> trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South\n> America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.\n>\n> Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist\n> organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,\n> control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will\n> have a disabling effect upon the terrorists\' ability to plan and operate.\n>\n> We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a\n> coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional\n> campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure\n> the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial\n> tools necessary to finish the task.\n>\n> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the\n> financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of\n> funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who\n> support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial\n> system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,\n> and prevent the movement of terrorists\' assets through alternative\n> financial networks.\n>\n> However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the\n> cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we\n> seek.\n>\n> We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:\n>\n> * direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and\n> international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist\n> organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of\n> terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction\n> (WMD) or their precursors;\n>\n> * defending the United States, the American people, and our interests\n> at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it\n> reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to\n> enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate\n> to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by\n> acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing\n> harm against our people and our country; and\n>\n> * denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists\n> by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign\n> responsibilities.\n>\n>\n> We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international\n> terrorism. This includes:\n>\n> * using the full influence of the United States, and working closely\n> with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are\n> illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as\n> slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government\n> can condone or support and all must oppose;\n>\n> * supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim\n> world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote\n> terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;\n>\n> * diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by\n> enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources\n> on areas most at risk; and\n>\n> * using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of\n> information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of\n> those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.\n>\n>\n> While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also\n> strengthening America\'s homeland security to protect against and deter\n> attack.\n>\n> This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization\n> since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council\n> and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland\n> Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental\n> reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland\n> encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public\n> and the private sector.\n>\n> This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,\n> emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with\n> terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened\n> to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and\n> mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop\n> terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.\n>\n> While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism\n> in today\'s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.\n> Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations\n> and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where\n> governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we\n> will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and\n> our allies can provide.\n>\n> As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work\n> with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as\n> non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the\n> humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to\n> rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,\n> threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists\n>\n> In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are\n> ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom\n> and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this\n> conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,\n> productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in\n> ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\n>\n> IV.

When violence erupts and states\n> falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to\n> alleviate suffering and restore stability.\n>\n> No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --\n> direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,\n> and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States\n> will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:\n>\n> * The United States should invest time and resources into building\n> international relationships and institutions that can help manage local\n> crises when they emerge.\n>\n> * The United States should be realistic about its ability to help\n> those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when\n> people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.\n>\n>\n> Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will\n> apply these principles:\n>\n> The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of\n> human suffering, because of America\'s close relationship with the state\n> of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region\'s importance\n> to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace\n> for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed\n> to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in\n> peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a\n> government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and\n> counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all\n> parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and\n> comprehensive settlement to the conflict.\n>\n> The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank\n> stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic\n> development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to\n> establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If\n> Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront\n> corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support\n> for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n>\n> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.\n> Permanent occupation threatens Israel\'s identity and democracy. So the\n> United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete\n> steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.\n> As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw\n> fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent\n> with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement\n> activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,\n> freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians\n> to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial\n> role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and\n> Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.\n>\n> In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India\n> and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested\n> time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and\n> Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a\n> constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With\n> Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan\'s\n> choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more\n> open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India\'s potential to\n> become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century\n> and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our\n> involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in\n> bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan\n> that can help defuse military confrontation.\n>\n> Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and\n> respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting\n> the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to\n> employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its\n> neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by\n> Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.\n>\n> In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with\n> countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,\n> Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic\n> hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,\n> opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as\n> the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States\n> (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of\n> the entire hemisphere.\n>\n> Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising\n> from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict\n> and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and\n> security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active\n> strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce\n> their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of\n> drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs\n> in our own country.\n>\n> In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist\n> groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking\n> activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are\n> working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat\n> illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective\n> sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic\n> security to the Colombian people.\n>\n> In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,\n> and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United\n> States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --\n> combating global terror. American interests and American principles,\n> therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an\n> African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.\n> Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa\'s\n> fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous\n> borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence\n> infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.\n>\n> An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars\n> spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions\n> of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to\n> confronting these emerging transnational threats.\n>\n> Africa\'s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that\n> focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This\n> administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the\n> region:\n>\n> * countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South\n> Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement\n> and require focused attention;\n>\n> * coordination with European allies and international institutions is\n> essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace\n> operations; and\n>\n> * Africa\'s capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations\n> must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational\n> threats on a sustained basis.\n>\n>\n> Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the\n> surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are\n> conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically\n> waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to\n> the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a\n> common responsibility for democratic political systems offers\n> opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.\n>\n> V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends\n> with Weapons of Mass Destruction\n>\n>\n> "The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and\n> technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear\n> weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,\n> even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to\n> strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and\n> have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the\n> capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and\n> we will oppose them with all our power."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> West Point, New York\n> June 1, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our\n> allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy\'s use of\n> force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the\n> collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security\n> environment has undergone profound transformation.\n>\n> Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our\n> relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the\n> balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear\n> arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as\n> counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were\n> inconceivable.\n>\n> But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.\n> None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power\n> that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and\n> motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain\n> destructive powers hitherto available only to the world\'s strongest\n> states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass\n> destruction against us, make today\'s security environment more complex\n> and dangerous.\n>\n> In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue\n> states that, while different in important ways, share a number of\n> attributes. These states:\n>\n> * brutalize their own people and squander their national resources\n> for the personal gain of the rulers;\n>\n> * display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,\n> and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;\n>\n> * are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with\n> other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively\n> to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;\n>\n> * sponsor terrorism around the globe; and\n>\n> * reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything\n> for which it stands.\n>\n>\n> At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq\'s\n> designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against\n> Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear\n> weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become\n> the world\'s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested\n> increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.\n> Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as\n> well. These states\' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has\n> become a looming threat to all nations.\n>\n> We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients\n> before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction\n> against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must\n> take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new\n> partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military\n> forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective\n> missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence\n> collection and analysis.\n>\n> Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:\n>\n> * Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend\n> against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key\n> capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce\n> capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our\n> homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated\n> into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of\n> our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed\n> adversaries.\n>\n> * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and\n> terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise\n> necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,\n> arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction\n> assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when\n> necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will\n> continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their\n> increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and\n> threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20\n> billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step\n> forward.\n>\n> * Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD\n> use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of\n> WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such\n> weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading\n> enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States\n> must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our\n> forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.\n>\n>\n> It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of\n> this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the\n> United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have\n> in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy\n> of today\'s threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be\n> caused by our adversaries\' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.\n> We cannot let our enemies strike first.\n>\n> * In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we\n> faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an\n> effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of\n> retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states\n> more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and\n> the wealth of their nations.\n>\n> * In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered\n> weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who\n> used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons\n> of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and\n> military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also\n> allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our\n> allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior\n> of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means\n> of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.\n>\n> * Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a\n> terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the\n> targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death\n> and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between\n> states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to\n> action.\n>\n>\n> For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer\n> an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves\n> against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars\n> and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption\n> on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible\n> mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n>\n> We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and\n> objectives of today\'s adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not\n> seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would\n> fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use\n> of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed\n> and delivered covertly and without warning.\n>\n> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian\n> population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law\n> of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,\n> mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and\n> these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired\n> and used weapons of mass destruction.\n>\n> The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions\n> to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the\n> threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling\n> the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if\n> uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy\'s attack. To\n> forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United\n> States will, if necessary, act preemptively.\n>\n> The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging\n> threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.\n> Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek\n> the world\'s most destructive technologies, the United States cannot\n> remain idle while dangers gather.\n>\n> We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our\n> actions. To support preemptive options, we will:\n>\n> * build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide\n> timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;\n>\n> * coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the\n> most dangerous threats; and\n>\n> * continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to\n> conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.\n>\n>\n> The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat\n> to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our\n> actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.\n>\n> VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and\n> Free Trade.\n>\n>\n> "When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a\n> privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever\n> enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in\n> better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade\n> revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Monterrey, Mexico\n> March 22, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing\n> prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth\n> supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher\n> incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs\n> economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it\n> reinforces the habits of liberty.\n>\n> We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America\'s\n> shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic\n> policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our\n> economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of\n> policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic\n> growth, including:\n>\n> * pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business\n> investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;\n>\n> * tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that\n> improve incentives for work and investment;\n>\n> * rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are\n> confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic\n> endeavors;\n>\n> * strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most\n> efficient use;\n>\n> * sound fiscal policies to support business activity;\n>\n> * investments in health and education that improve the well-being and\n> skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and\n>\n> * free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the\n> diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and\n> opportunity.\n>\n>\n> The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not\n> command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the\n> best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further\n> strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for\n> all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the\n> developing world.\n>\n> A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.\n> national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies\n> for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake\n> of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in\n> their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are\n> Japan\'s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of\n> non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to\n> use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --\n> including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they\n> are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher\n> global economic growth.\n>\n> Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic\n> growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand\n> the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging\n> markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise\n> living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a\n> world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that\n> allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in\n> their future.\n>\n> We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve\n> access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will\n> continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial\n> markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International\n> Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action\n> Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and\n> more effectively resolving them when they occur.\n>\n> The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from\n> occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing\n> so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy\n> conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on\n> achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,\n> exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.\n>\n> The concept of "free trade" arose as a moral principle even before it\n> became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others\n> value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something\n> that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the\n> freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free\n> trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:\n>\n> * Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we\n> helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,\n> especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for\n> completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the\n> accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade\n> Organization. We will assist Russia\'s preparations to join the WTO.\n>\n> * Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies\n> in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of\n> the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United\n> States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,\n> targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and\n> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the\n> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences\n> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free\n> trade.\n>\n> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the\n> free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration\n> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and\n> Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of\n> developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.\n> Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will\n> be our principal focal points.\n>\n> * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every\n> administration\'s trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with\n> Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished\n> majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing\n> Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for\n> developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will\n> work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade\n> agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade\n> Promotion Authority.\n>\n> * Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade\n> policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,\n> competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open\n> societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional\n> integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in\n> developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa\n> Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods\n> produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more\n> use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue\n> to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer\n> countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,\n> the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public\n> health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are\n> flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical\n> medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and\n> malaria.\n>\n> * Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.\n> Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on\n> enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing\n> disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a\n> global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations\n> that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws\n> against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international\n> community must be able to address genuine concerns about government\n> subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which\n> undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.\n>\n> * Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound\n> statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used\n> in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the\n> American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the\n> enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that\n> the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American\n> workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the\n> change and dynamism of open markets.\n>\n> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster\n> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with\n> widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental\n> concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy "network"\n> between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the\n> International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade\n> talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.\n>\n> * Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security\n> and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our\n> allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and\n> types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,\n> Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to\n> work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient\n> technologies.\n>\n>\n> Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize\n> greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing\n> them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the\n> global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America\'s greenhouse\n> gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such\n> emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10\n> years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be\n> to:\n>\n> * remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for\n> international cooperation;\n>\n> * obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of\n> the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to\n> companies that can show real cuts;\n>\n> * develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission\n> reductions;\n>\n> * promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as\n> well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,\n> while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;\n>\n> * increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to\n> a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change\n> by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year\'s\n> budget; and\n>\n> * assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas\n> emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and\n> resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and\n> better path.\n>\n>\n> VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building\n> the Infrastructure of Democracy\n>\n>\n> "In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to\n> rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we\n> must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> President Bush\n> Washington, D.C. (Inter-American\n> Development Bank)\n> March 14, 2002\n>\n>\n>\n> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human\n> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including\n> all of the world\'s poor in an expanding circle of development -- and\n> opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of\n> U.S. international policy.\n>\n> Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic\n> growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served\n> to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and\n> perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars\n> spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction\n> achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.\n>\n> Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this\n> failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing\n> for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and\n> the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.\n>\n> This Administration\'s goal is to help unleash the productive potential\n> of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is\n> impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have\n> implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels\n> of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should\n> set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world\'s\n> poorest economies within a decade.\n>\n> The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to\n> achieve this goal:\n>\n> * Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of\n> national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core\n> development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our\n> present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,\n> these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge\n> Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest\n> in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight\n> corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest\n> in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and\n> enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward\n> countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those\n> that have not to implement reforms.\n>\n> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development\n> banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a\n> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other\n> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of\n> the world\'s poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.\n> contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.\n> contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the\n> World Bank\'s fund for the poorest countries -- and the African\n> Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing\n> poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially\n> in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral\n> development banks to focus on activities that increase economic\n> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,\n> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant\n> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in\n> developing countries.\n>\n> * Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development\n> assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world\'s\n> poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that\n> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to\n> health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a\n> better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure\n> the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering\n> results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own\n> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral\n> development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for\n> achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n> replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation\n> system that measures recipient countries\' progress. For the first time,\n> donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the\n> achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.\n> contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the\n> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this\n> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything\n> that these institutions do.\n>\n> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants\n> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n> agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the\n> poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,\n> sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress\n> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development\n> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private\n> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support\n> development projects that show results.\n>\n> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are\n> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,\n> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and\n> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows\n> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national\n> security strategy.\n>\n> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor\n> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics\n> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be\n> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the\n> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest\n> governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective\n> local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new\n> global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan\n> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than\n> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the\n> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.\n>\n> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of\n> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources\n> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States\n> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n> percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher\n> training in Africa. The United States can also bring information\n> technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been\n> devastated by AIDS.\n>\n> * Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,\n> including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields\n> in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.\n> Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits\n> to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still\n> suffer from hunger and malnutrition.\n>\n>\n> VIII.

NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice,\n> highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to\n> respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.\n>\n> The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,\n> creating coalitions under NATO\'s own mandate, as well as contributing to\n> mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:\n>\n> * expand NATO\'s membership to those democratic nations willing and\n> able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;\n>\n> * ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate\n> combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;\n>\n> * develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become\n> effective multinational fighting forces;\n>\n> * take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of\n> scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that\n> they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;\n>\n> * streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to\n> meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of\n> training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;\n> and\n>\n> * maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as\n> we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.\n>\n>\n> If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a\n> partnership as central to the security and interests of its member\n> states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common\n> perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to\n> take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the\n> same time, we welcome our European allies\' efforts to forge a greater\n> foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to\n> close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We\n> cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of\n> transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.\n>\n> The attacks of September 11 energized America\'s Asian alliances.\n> Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an\n> attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the\n> dispatch of some of the world\'s finest combat forces for Operation\n> Enduring Freedom.

We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our\n> alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received\n> invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.\n>\n> The war against terrorism has proven that America\'s alliances in Asia\n> not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and\n> ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and\n> friendships, we will:\n>\n>\n> * look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and\n> global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our\n> close defense and diplomatic cooperation;\n>\n> * work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while\n> preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of\n> the region over the longer-term;\n>\n> * build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we\n> continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as\n> we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;\n>\n> * maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our\n> allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic\n> environment; and\n>\n> * build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with\n> institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n> forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage\n> change in this dynamic region.\n>\n>\n> We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power\n> competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of\n> internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all\n> three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly\n> global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.\n>\n> With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based\n> on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and\n> Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on\n> Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a\n> critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,\n> long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United\n> States.

Russia\'s very\n> weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those\n> opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even\n> decades.\n>\n> The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral\n> relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests\n> require a strong relationship with India.

But\n> while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about\n> India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with\n> which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership\n> with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic\n> future.\n>\n> The United States relationship with China is an important part of our\n> strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific\n> region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous\n> China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future.\n> Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst\n> features of the Communist legacy, China\'s leaders have not yet made the\n> next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.\n> In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its\n> neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated\n> path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national\n> greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is\n> the only source of that greatness.\n>\n> The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing\n> China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including\n> the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean\n> peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan\n> and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and\n> similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats,\n> such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the\n> welfare of our citizens.\n>\n> Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become\n> more open with information, promote the development of civil society,\n> and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to\n> political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting\n> village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national\n> one-party rule by the Communist Party.

You know\n\'weapons of mass destruction\'. etc. etc.\n\n==\nhttp://dc.internet.com/news/article.php/10849_1467121\n\nSeptember 20, 2002\nSenate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill\nBy Roy Mark\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to\npromote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron\nWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act\nwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is\nco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).\n\nThe proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would\nsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective\neducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers\nand professionals.\n\n"The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step\nforward for this very small technology," Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to\nfull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. "Nowhere in the world\nare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of\nnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to\nlead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide\nthe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate\nnew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will\nensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."\n\nThe bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology\nprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also\ncreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National\nNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and\ntechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.\n\n"My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to\nchange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer\nrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will\nmine the opportunities of nanotechnology," Wyden said in introducing the\nbill. "At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a\nhalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various\nnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world\'s leader\nin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to\nachieving that goal.\n\nTo study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for\nSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to\nNanotechnology would also be established.\n\nAccording to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the\nNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.\n\nThose recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;\nemphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and\nshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,\nequipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research\nthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting\ninterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology\ntransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal\nimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,\neducational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for\nmeasuring progress toward program goals.\n\n\n\n'
'\n\n\nRelated to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?\n\n==\nhttp://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271\n\nSun Nabs Storage Startup\nBy Clint Boulton\nAmid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San\nFrancisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data\nstorage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.\n\nThe Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup\nwith a keen eye for the startup\'s switching (define) devices and\nvirtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),\nvirtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices\ninto what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that\nis managed from a central console.\n\nThough major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes\nof Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after\nscouting some 65 companies.\n\nMark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com\nthat Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible\nacquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of\nstorage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such\nas Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.\n\n"This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7\nor 8 system-level players," Lovington said. "Sun sees this acquisition as a\ncritical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious."\n\nN1 is Sun\'s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)\narchitecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a\nrole in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled\nas the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and\nnetworks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.\n\nWhile lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground\nin the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,\naccording to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of\nIDC\'s Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest\nincreases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,\nrespectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of\n$411 million.\n\nSun\'s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of\nSun\'s 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.\n\n\n\n'

Ooops, no wait, scratch that.\n\nThere is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be\nprecisely "free trade/markets" -- when Ben Franklin first visited\nEngland he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben\nexplained that they used "Colonial Script", a kind of barter-dollar,\nand increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The\nBritish bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to\nclamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were\nrife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.\n\nAccording to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political\nparty here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about\ntea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were\nprotesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces\nthat killed Ned Ludd\'s followers as to why popular opinion believes\nthey were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada\nwas also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the\nlate-50\'s or early 60\'s, the right to print money was removed from the\njuristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.\n\nI\'ve wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse\nof the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of\nother causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when\nwe only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?\n\n-- \nGary Lawrence Murphy - garym@teledyn.com - TeleDynamics Communications\n - blog: http://www.auracom.com/~teledyn - biz: http://teledyn.com/ -\n  "Computers are useless.

Can you say\n"Bootstraps", boys and girls?

If we ever get\naround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\ntransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer\'s\ngovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\ninnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\nsummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\nthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\n\nThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\nbest school possible.\n\nWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\nfor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don\'t take my word for it,\nask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\nyears for proof.\n\nMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\nWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\nChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\ngoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\nafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\ncouldn\'t afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\nlast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\nand "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\n\nThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"\ndegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\nlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\nbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\ndeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\nwho don\'t work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\nsmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\nBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\nrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I\'m using it to\nbeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\nwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\nMissouri, and *I* don\'t have a degree in anything actually useful,\nmuch less a "terminal" one, which means *I*\'m broker than anyone on\nthis list -- it\'s just that *you*, of all people, lots with\neducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\nfacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\nThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\neconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\nignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\nintelligence and effort.\n\n[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\ncompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\napparently.]\n\n\n\nBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\nall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\nthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\nmost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\nall of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency and\nnot "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\nThat efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in The\nPeople\'s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\nstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\napparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you\'d\nknow about it by now.

A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\n\nOnce the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a "public" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\n\nGATHERING THE DATA\n\nWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\n\nThe MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their "brightness" - varies according to temperature.\n\nChristy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\n\n\n\nVERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\n\nA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a "remarkable" level of agreement between the two.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by "radiosonde" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\n\nHe found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\n\n"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement," Christy said. "If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."\n\nThe 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\n\nGlobally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\n\n"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet," Christy said. "They are not representative of the total globe."\n\nRadiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\n\nWhile there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\n\nIn an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\n\n\n\nGLOBAL COVERAGE\n\nOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\n\nThe \'global temperature\' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\n\nThe most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\n\nMost of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\n\nThe ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\n\nTemperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. "Radiosonde" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\n\nWhile balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth\'s surface.\n\nWater temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard "ships of opportunity." The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\n\nIn the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\n\n\n\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU\n\nWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.\n\nEach satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\n\nBecause the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\n\nTo check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\n\n\n\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS\n\nOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local "asphalt effect" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\n\n\n\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY\n\nWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.\n\nThe thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.\n\nOnly in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.\n\n\n\nTHE SCIENTISTS\n\nIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society\'s Special Award. They were honored "for developing a global, precise record of the Earth\'s temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."\n\nAMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.\n\nIn 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA\'s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.\n\n\n\nDR. JOHN CHRISTY\n\nChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S.

'\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/23/opinion/23HERB.html?todaysheadlines=&pagewanted=print&position=top\n\n The New York Times\nSeptember 23, 2002\nHigh-Altitude Rambos\nBy BOB HERBERT\n\nDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake\nWorth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in\none of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the\nU.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from\nAtlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section\nbegan behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do\nwith Dr. Rajcoomar.\n\nTwo U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back\nto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight\nman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer\nrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying\nout for the lead roles in Hollywood\'s latest action extravaganza.\n\nThey handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him\nin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite\njittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight\nattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,\nalready scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were\nnot ready to let things quiet down.\n\nOne of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The\nmarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and\nremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any\nreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try\nto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who\ndisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.\n\nThe passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were\nterrorists on the plane.\n\n"I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized\ncabin," said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of\nCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an\naisle seat in coach. "I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire\nin a shootout."\n\nDr. Rajcoomar\'s wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her\nhusband, said, "It was really like Rambo in the air." She worried that\nthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore\ndid not understand the marshals\' orders. If someone got up to go to the\nbathroom, he or she might be shot.\n\nThere were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When\nthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into\ncustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals\ngrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that\nanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where\nhe was thrown into a filthy cell.\n\nThis was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.\nRajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into\ncustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening\nhours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.\n\nOfficials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were\neventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.\nMcCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,\nwhich is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the\nincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.\nRajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident "too\nclosely."\n\nIf that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters\nare headed for jail.\n\nDr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. "I\nhad never been treated like that in my life," he said. "I was afraid that I\nwas about to be beaten up or killed."\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and\nhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful\ndetention.\n\n"We have to take a look at what we\'re doing in the name of security," said\nDr. Rajcoomar. "So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in\nthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of\nsecurity."\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.

'\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB10327475102363433,00.html\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nSeptember 23, 2002\nCOMMENTARY\n\nRebuild at Ground Zero\n\nBy LARRY SILVERSTEIN\n\nEarlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the\nhorrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who\nperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\nand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\namenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\nthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims\' families and,\nindeed, for all of us.\n\nBut for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\nfeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\nmust be replaced on the site.\n\nAbout 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\nalong with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\nTogether, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\neconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\nof the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\nhave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\nYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\nmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\n\nIf we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\nvibrancy it had as the world\'s financial center. Love them or hate them,\nand there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\nmade a powerful statement to the world that said, "This is New York, a\nsymbol of our free economy and of our way of life." That is why they were\ndestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\nwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\n\nIn recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\nsources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\nall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\nfeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\nsimply never rebuilt.\n\nThese proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\nrecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\nthe towers\' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\noffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\n\nAccess to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\nThat was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\nbefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\nremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\nand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\nplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\n"Train-to-the-Plane" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\neven more the logical locus of office development.\n\nAnd New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\nforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\nSecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\nmillion square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\nanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\nheightens the need.\n\nAs for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\ncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\nhistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\noffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\nup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\nat an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\n\nWe are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\nover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\nline until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\nannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s\'\nrate.\n\nThose who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\npreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\nextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\nwill most New Yorkers.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\nthat the city "has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\nfuture." I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\nand that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\nsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\nhappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\nresidents of the area.\n\nThe challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.\n\nMr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm\nwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

Just for the record - \nthe average salary for\na university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ \n21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder\nhalf of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call \ncenters that\nhave arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some \nentry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an\nhour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in \n1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference\nis that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other \nwords, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, \n union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument \nto this is that many college graduates\n leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is \nthat we are the thin edge\n(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of \nthird-world wages and work practices coming\n to North America.\n\nI worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they \ncould maintain that (and prosper) just says\n volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people \nthere, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote\nwith my feet. They didn\'t quite realize that just about every large \nemployer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway\neventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired \nemployees were brought in by the employer (rumours were\nthat they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of \nrum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed\n a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, \nguess what - used to be a VP at the company.\nThat\'s free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - \nas I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long\nas the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in \nplace.\n\nAnd if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of \nsome free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,\nare going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received \ngenerous subsidies, in return, I\'m sure, for an understanding about\nthe labor markets here.\n\n>\n>BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n>*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\n>all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\n>there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\n>most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n>*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\n>all of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency and\n>not "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n>\n>That efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in The\n>People\'s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge.

A particularly \ngalling example is\nhigh-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that \nit is an area where the pricing\napproaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the \ntelecom industry (maintain your\nmonopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through \nthe same regulators) meet.\nSadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole \nentertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing\nseems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer \nseems less important than using\nregulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to \nproduce profits for the favored few.\n\n>\n>In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\n>theft, the rich don\'t get rich off the backs of the poor, and\n>redistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just\n>that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n>\n>To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\n>wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n>  \n>\nI usually agree - but when there\'s a Republican in office -  I feel like \nthey\'re the biggest believers in\nthe Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the \nrights of that "proletariat" you\'ve\njust created with bogus "law and order" policies , concentrate capital \nin the hands of a few (ideally people\nwho can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, \nand lie - use\nthe word "compassionate" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain \namount of poverty reduction actually\nhelps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the \nRepublic party seems to be the more homeless under\n each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.\n\nAnd the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining \nstandards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,\ngreater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the \nwork force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right\n to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining \nstandards of living) is the reality.\n\nAgain to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - \nthe CIA world factbook - on the US economy:\n\n"Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to \nthe top 20% of households"\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

'\n\n\nFor anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the\nGreens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn\'t existed they\nwould have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their\nfundamental opposition isn\'t to a warmer earth, it is to industrial\ncivilization.\n\nThe fact that the sattelites didn\'t match what the global warming\ntheorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the\ntemperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have\nbeen validated with a different means of measurement.\n\nRather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global\nwarming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the\n"Medieval Warm Period".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,\nand it obvioiusly wasn\'t caused by CO2.\n\nIn point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused\nDIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn\'t trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,\nand if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have\nyour warming theory.\n\nYet it would seem that the very stability of the earth\'s climate over\nlong periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback\nloops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.\n\nMore water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more\nclouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great\ndeal on how the cloud formation shakes out.

Most scientists studying global climate change believe that\nthese increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for\nincreased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.\n\n> It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited\n> during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of\n> humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers\n> paved over their civilization.

The point of global warming\nisn\'t to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to\nunderstand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on\nglobal human activity.\n\n> For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are\n> anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I\'ll\n> just stick with Occam\'s Razor for now.\n\nThe increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.\n\nIt is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment\nsubject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the\ncurrent best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2\nconcentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth\nshould be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may\nbe difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I\nencourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to\neventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident\nas heat.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n'

'\n\nI\'ve seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums\nfor several years.  I\'ve always found archaeology interesting for no\nparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I\nactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm\n\nDefrosting the past\n\nAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty\nof a warming world\n\nBY ALEX MARKELS\n\nAs he hiked near Colorado\'s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed\nKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000\nfeet. "It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor and\namateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, \'That\'s strange. Bison don\'t\nlive this high up.\' "\n\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\nbison–one that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinary\ndiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum\'s chief curator, adding that it\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There\'s\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."\n\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn\'t the only place where glaciers and\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\nto Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\nindustry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world\'s 70,000 glaciers. As\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists\' understanding of our\npredecessors\' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\n\n"It\'s mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\nstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "Ice\nMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\n\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\nNature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they\'re\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\ndon\'t even realize they\'re ancient.\n\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\ndead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I looked\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."\n\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\nthe fallen hunter\'s body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts\'inchi, or Long Ago\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\n\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\nfirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of people\nliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now we\nsee that this area was very much part of people\'s seasonal activities."\n\nLike Ward\'s discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\ncaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn\'t been\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then a\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\n\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like a\npencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\nice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\nyears of changing hunting practices.\n\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\nsome equipment in the ice. "We\'ve got people hunting with throwing darts\nup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the research\nproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there\'s no more throwing\ndarts."\n\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska\'s Wrangell\nand St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States\' most glaciated\nterrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\nthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitude\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We\'re\nprobably about the only ones happy about it."\n\n\n\n\n'
'\n\n[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the \narticle I was commenting on... Rohit]\n\nIn your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("The \nSearch Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most \nsubversive aspect of Google\'s service is not its card catalog, which \nmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By \nmaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, \nif you can get to Google\'s cache, you can read anything you\'d like.\n\nThe techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce \nthese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from \nGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all \nWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) \nencryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to \nSSL makes it effectively impossible for a \'man-in-the-middle\' to meddle; \ncensorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in \nChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of \nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in \nthe article.\n\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic \ncosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free \nflow of information, why shouldn\'t the Broadcasting Board of Governors \nsponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest \nof the Web?\n\nTo date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector \nprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just \nimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure \naccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom \nof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most \nof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.\n\nOn second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* \nthe use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...\n\nBest,\n   Rohit Khare\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe search goes on\nChina backtracks on banning Google—up to a point\n\nSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING\n From The Economist print edition\n\nIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, \nis gougou, meaning “doggy”. For the country\'s fast-growing population of \nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving \nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked \naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently \nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to \nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been \nrestored.\n\nAn unusual climbdown by China\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More \nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to \nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. \nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by \nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for \nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\n\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users \nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. \nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet \nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site \nto far less powerful search engines in China.\n\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, \nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to \ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking \nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be \nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key \nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this \nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on \nGoogle for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search \nalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.\n\n\n'

There is one Starbucks for every 7,000\nresidents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle\nalso has two other major coffee chains, Tully\'s Coffee and Seattle\'s\nBest Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.\n\nA recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the\ntax. "For people outside of Seattle who don\'t understand the\nconsumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"\nsaid John Burbank, the think tank\'s executive director, "but it was\ncommon sense."\n\nResearch by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that\npeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But\nbecause of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on\nespresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.\n\nBurbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a\nyear. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research\nshows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.\n\nBurbank\'s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The\nthink tank\'s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of\nlow-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.\n\nBurbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs\nmade earlier this year by Gov.

She\nsupports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be\nexpected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on\nthe menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.\n\nSome say the tax isn\'t the issue; they just resent being singled out.\n\nDavid Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a\nday, which means he\'d be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. "I, for\none, don\'t have kids, but I drink espresso," he said, as he sewed a\nleather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. "I don\'t mind paying, but I\nthink everyone should pay."\n\nCoffeehouses are steamed about it, and they\'ve organized as\nJOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle\'s\nChamber of Commerce and the city\'s two largest coffee franchises,\nStarbucks and Tully\'s.\n\nThe tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that\ncontains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare\nfor smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If\nespresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a\ncity audit.\n\nUniversity of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn\'t add up. \n\n"The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is\nneither," he said. "On the efficiency side, it\'s surely going to lead\nto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to\navoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using\nfinely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]\nand that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be\nright? I don\'t know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal\nfees that could have gone to child care.\n\n"Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious\nidea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They\'ve pitted espresso\ndrinkers against child-care supporters, and who\'s going to side with\nthe espresso drinkers?"\n\nIn fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political\ntwo-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public\nstance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,\ncorporations continually advertise their commitment to social\nactivism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members\nprefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.\n\n"Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and\nchildhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we\ncontribute annually," the company said. "However, Starbucks does not\nunderstand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an\nadditional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single\nconsumer product."\n\nThe City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before\nvoters next year. The initiative\'s authors say it is directed at\nvendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through\nhigher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.\nThe tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of\nespresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.\n\nBurbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of\nconsumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he\'s been\npitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime\nevery time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.\n\nIt\'s the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds\nfunny. "I drink espresso," she said, laughing, "and I am not rich."\n\n\n\n\nJH> "I did not have sex with that woman."\n\n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nJH> Mr.\n>> FoRK\n>> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:12 PM\n>> To: FoRK\n>> Subject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming\n>> \n>> \n>> ----- Original Message -----\n>> From: "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net>\n>> \n>> > A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn\'t existed they\n>> > would have had to invent it.\n>> A Republican once said "I am not a crook".\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n'

Can you say\n"Bootstraps", boys and girls? I knew you could...\n\n[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,\nlike, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught\nyou in a government-run "high" school, you\'ll probably get more of\n*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get\naround to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing\ntransfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer\'s\ngovernment-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of\ninnumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this\nsummer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out\nthere, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]\n\n\nThe *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a\n"terminal" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the\nbest school possible.\n\nWhy? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,\nfor instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don\'t take my word for it,\nask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the\nyears for proof.\n\nMeritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after\nWorld War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,\nChicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who\ngoes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually\nafford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who\ncouldn\'t afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the\nlast 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,\nand "biased" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.\n\n\nThe bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with "terminal"\ndegrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or\nlearn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss\nbasis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after\ndeath, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people\nwho don\'t work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*\nsmart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.\n\nBTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this\nrhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I\'m using it to\nbeat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You\nwere, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to\nMissouri, and *I* don\'t have a degree in anything actually useful,\nmuch less a "terminal" one, which means *I*\'m broker than anyone on\nthis list -- it\'s just that *you*, of all people, lots with\neducations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The\nfacts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.\nThere are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and\neconomics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including\nignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,\nintelligence and effort.\n\n[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of\ncompetence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,\napparently.]\n\n\n\nBTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,\n*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,\nall those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and\nthere would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,\nmost of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have\n*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically\nall of that "new" money would have come from economic efficiency and\nnot "stolen" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.\n\nThat efficiency is called "progress", for those of you in The\nPeople\'s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better\nstuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept\napparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you\'d\nknow about it by now. In economic terms, it\'s also called an increase\nin general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I\'m not talking about\nextorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who\ndoesn\'t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some\npolitician as Santa Claus come election time...\n\n\nIn short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not\ntheft, the rich don\'t get rich off the backs of the poor, and\nredistributionist labor "theory" of value happy horseshit is just\nthat: horseshit, happy or otherwise.\n\nTo believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx\nwrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPY511cPxH8jf3ohaEQLAsgCfZhsQMSvUy6GqJ5wgL52DwZKpIhMAnRuR\nYYboc+IcylP5TlKL58jpwEfu\n=z877\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--\n-----------------\nR.

Rohit]\n\nIn your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("The\nSearch Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most\nsubversive aspect of Google\'s service is not its card catalog, which\nmerely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By\nmaintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,\nif you can get to Google\'s cache, you can read anything you\'d like.\n\nThe techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce\nthese rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from\nGoogle, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all\nWeb browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\nencryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to\nSSL makes it effectively impossible for a \'man-in-the-middle\' to meddle;\ncensorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in\nChina. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of\nIP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in\nthe article.\n\nOf course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic\ncosts real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free\nflow of information, why shouldn\'t the Broadcasting Board of Governors\nsponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest\nof the Web?\n\nTo date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector\nprogramming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just\nimagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure\naccess to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom\nof the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most\nof it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.\n\nOn second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*\nthe use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...\n\nBest,\n   Rohit Khare\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe search goes on\nChina backtracks on banning Google—up to a point\n\nSep 19th 2002 | BEIJING\n From The Economist print edition\n\nIN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,\nis gougou, meaning “doggy”. For the country\'s fast-growing population of\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been\nrestored.\n\nAn unusual climbdown by China\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\n\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\n\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key\nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this\nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on\nGoogle for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search\nalso rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.\n\n\n\n'
'\n\nAnyone who doesn\'t appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at\npart of the equation.\n\nAmerica has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is\na huge one -- you don\'t necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There\nis an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the\nright time, to go that high.\n\nBeyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is\ninvolved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.\nThough I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.\nCindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.\n\nMost people, of course, aren\'t in those stratified realms.  It is the\nrest of us who tend to sort.\n\nThere is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the\nfirst place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn\'t exist.  Sowell seems to agree\nat least in part, but I\'m sure Sowell would also state that the benefits\nof pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.\n\nAnd if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity\nof heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most\npeople seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better\nif it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the\nForbes list, or even just being a garden variety \'millionaire next door\'\nis more likely to be the \'serving customers\' definition.\n\nDifferences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far\nmore animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.\nSuperior performance, often not.\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of\nGeege\n> Schuman\n> Sent: Monday, September 23, 2002 4:44 PM\n> To: R.

'\n\nThanks for the link - I\'m fascinated by archaeology as well.\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: "James Rogers" <jamesr@best.com>\nTo: <fork@example.com>\nSent: Monday, September 23, 2002 2:48 PM\nSubject: Re: Goodbye Global Warming\n\n\nI\'ve seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums\nfor several years.  I\'ve always found archaeology interesting for no\nparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I\nactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm\n\nDefrosting the past\n\nAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty\nof a warming world\n\nBY ALEX MARKELS\n\nAs he hiked near Colorado\'s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed\nKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000\nfeet. "It looked like a bison skull," the building contractor and\namateur archaeologist recalls. "I thought, \'That\'s strange. Bison don\'t\nlive this high up.\' "\n\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\nbison–one that died about 340 years ago. "This was an extraordinary\ndiscovery," says Russ Graham, the museum\'s chief curator, adding that it\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. "There\'s\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found."\n\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn\'t the only place where glaciers and\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\nto Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\nindustry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world\'s 70,000 glaciers. As\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists\' understanding of our\npredecessors\' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\n\n"It\'s mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\nstudying these remains," says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old "Ice\nMan," found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\n\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\nNature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they\'re\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\ndon\'t even realize they\'re ancient.\n\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\ndead animal. "It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. "But when I looked\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."\n\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\nthe fallen hunter\'s body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts\'inchi, or Long Ago\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\n\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\nfirst place. "Before this there was no archaeological record of people\nliving here," says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. "Now we\nsee that this area was very much part of people\'s seasonal activities."\n\nLike Ward\'s discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\ncaribou dung. "It was really odd, because I knew there hadn\'t been\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years," recalls Kuzyk, then a\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\n\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found "what looked like a\npencil with string wrapped around it." It turned out to be a\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\nice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\nyears of changing hunting practices.\n\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\nsome equipment in the ice. "We\'ve got people hunting with throwing darts\nup until 1,200 years ago," says Hare, who now oversees the research\nproject. "Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there\'s no more throwing\ndarts."\n\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska\'s Wrangell\nand St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States\' most glaciated\nterrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\nthe Ice Man. "Global warming is providing us high-altitude\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We\'re\nprobably about the only ones happy about it."\n\n\n'

'\n\nhttp://newyorker.com/fact/content/?020401fa_FACT1\n\nThe New Yorker\n\nTHE NEXT WORLD ORDER\nby NICHOLAS LEMANN\nThe Bush Administration may have a brand-new doctrine of power.\nIssue of 2002-04-01\nPosted 2002-03-25\n\nWhen there is a change of command-and not just in government-the new people\noften persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone\nsuspected. This feeling seems especially intense in the Bush\nAdministration, perhaps because Bill Clinton has been bracketed by a\nfather-son team. It\'s easy for people in the Administration to believe\nthat, after an unfortunate eight-year interlude, the Bush family has\nresumed its governance-and about time, too.\n\nThe Bush Administration\'s sense that the Clinton years were a waste, or\nworse, is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs.\nRepublicans tend to regard Democrats as untrustworthy in defense and\nforeign policy, anyway, in ways that coincide with what people think of as\nClinton\'s weak points: an eagerness to please, a lack of discipline.\nCondoleezza Rice, Bush\'s national-security adviser, wrote an article in\nForeign Affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused Clinton\nof "an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the\ncommander in chief." Most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this\nAdministration also served under the President\'s father. They took office\nlast year, after what they regard as eight years of small-time flyswatting\nby Clinton, thinking that they were picking up where they\'d left off.\n\nNot long ago, I had lunch with-sorry!-a senior Administration\nforeign-policy official, at a restaurant in Washington called the Oval\nRoom. Early in the lunch, he handed me a twenty-seven- page report, whose\ncover bore the seal of the Department of Defense, an outline map of the\nworld, and these words:\n\nDefense Strategy for the 1990s:\nThe Regional Defense Strategy\nSecretary of Defense\nDick Cheney\nJanuary 1993\n\nOne of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is\ncommunicating its drama. Actors, professional athletes, and even elected\npoliticians train for years, go through a great winnowing, and then perform\npublicly. People who have titles like Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense\nare just as ambitious and competitive, have worked just as long and hard,\nand are often playing for even higher stakes-but what they do all day is go\nto meetings and write memos and prepare briefings. How, possibly, to\nexplain that some of the documents, including the report that the senior\nofficial handed me, which was physically indistinguishable from a\nhigh-school term paper, represent the government version of playing\nCarnegie Hall?\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dick Cheney, then the Secretary of\nDefense, set up a "shop," as they say, to think about American foreign\npolicy after the Cold War, at the grand strategic level. The project, whose\nexistence was kept quiet, included people who are now back in the game, at\na higher level: among them, Paul Wolfowitz, the Deputy Secretary of\nDefense; Lewis Libby, Cheney\'s chief of staff; and Eric Edelman, a senior\nforeign-policy adviser to Cheney-generally speaking, a cohesive group of\nconservatives who regard themselves as bigger-thinking, tougher-minded, and\nintellectually bolder than most other people in Washington. (Donald\nRumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, shares these characteristics, and has\nbeen closely associated with Cheney for more than thirty years.) Colin\nPowell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mounted a\ncompeting, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine\nAmerican foreign policy and defense. A date was set-May 21, 1990-on which\neach team would brief Cheney for an hour; Cheney would then brief President\nBush, after which Bush would make a foreign-policy address unveiling the\nnew grand strategy.\n\nEverybody worked for months on the "five-twenty-one brief," with a sense\nthat the shape of the post-Cold War world was at stake. When Wolfowitz and\nPowell arrived at Cheney\'s office on May 21st, Wolfowitz went first, but\nhis briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and Cheney (a hawk who,\nperhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. Powell didn\'t\nget to present his alternate version of the future of the United States in\nthe world until a couple of weeks later. Cheney briefed President Bush,\nusing material mostly from Wolfowitz, and Bush prepared his major\nforeign-policy address. But he delivered it on August 2, 1990, the day that\nIraq invaded Kuwait, so nobody noticed.\n\nThe team kept working. In 1992, the Times got its hands on a version of the\nmaterial, and published a front-page story saying that the Pentagon\nenvisioned a future in which the United States could, and should, prevent\nany other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. A few weeks of\ncontroversy ensued about the Bush Administration\'s hawks being\n"unilateral"-controversy that Cheney\'s people put an end to with denials\nand the counter-leak of an edited, softer version of the same material.\n\nAs it became apparent that Bush was going to lose to Clinton, the Cheney\nteam\'s efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. The report that the\nsenior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before\nClinton took office. It is a somewhat bland, opaque document-a "scrubbed,"\nmeaning unclassified, version of something more candid-but it contained the\nessential ideas of "shaping," rather than reacting to, the rest of the\nworld, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. Its tone is one of\nskepticism about diplomatic partnerships. A more forthright version of the\nsame ideas can be found in a short book titled "From Containment to Global\nLeadership?," which Zalmay Khalilzad, who joined Cheney\'s team in 1991 and\nis now special envoy to Afghanistan, published a couple of years into the\nClinton Administration, when he was out of government. It recommends that\nthe United States "preclude the rise of another global rival for the\nindefinite future." Khalilzad writes, "It is a vital U.S. interest to\npreclude such a development-i.e., to be willing to use force if necessary\nfor the purpose."\n\nWhen George W. Bush was campaigning for President, he and the people around\nhim didn\'t seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of\nthe policy of containment of the Soviet Union\'s sphere of influence which\nthe United States maintained during the Cold War. In his first major\nforeign-policy speech, delivered in November of 1999, Bush declared that "a\nPresident must be a clear-eyed realist," a formulation that seems to\nconnote an absence of world-remaking ambition. "Realism" is exactly the\nforeign-policy doctrine that Cheney\'s Pentagon team rejected, partly\nbecause it posits the impossibility of any one country\'s ever dominating\nworld affairs for any length of time.\n\nOne gets many reminders in Washington these days of how much the terrorist\nattacks of September 11th have changed official foreign-policy thinking.\nAny chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what Bush\nhas done so far-made war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda and enhanced domestic\nsecurity. It is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly\nentering the realm of Presidential choice, and all indications are that\nBush is going to use September 11th as the occasion to launch a new,\naggressive American foreign policy that would represent a broad change in\ndirection rather than a specific war on terrorism. All his rhetoric,\nespecially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of Congress\nsince September 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which\nhis aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation\'s moment of\ndestiny-a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging,\nbecause it enhances Bush\'s stature and opens the way to more assertive\npolicymaking.\n\nInside government, the reason September 11th appears to have been "a\ntransformative moment," as the senior official I had lunch with put it, is\nnot so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials\nhad previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the American\npublic\'s usual resistance to American military involvement overseas, at\nleast for a while. The Clinton Administration, beginning with the "Black\nHawk Down" operation in Mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the\nconviction that Americans were highly averse to casualties; the all-bombing\nKosovo operation, in Clinton\'s next-to-last year, was the ideal foreign\nmilitary adventure. Now that the United States has been attacked, the\noptions are much broader. The senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999\nstudy of casualty aversion by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies,\nwhich argued that the "mass public" is much less casualty-averse than the\nmilitary or the civilian élite believes; for example, the study showed that\nthe public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to\nprevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (The American\ndeath total in the Vietnam War was about fifty-eight thousand.) September\n11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further.\n\nRecently, I went to the White House to interview Condoleezza Rice. Rice\'s\nForeign Affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration: "The United\nStates has found it exceedingly difficult to define its \'national interest\'\nin the absence of Soviet power." I asked her whether that is still the\ncase. "I think the difficulty has passed in defining a role," she said\nimmediately. "I think September 11th was one of those great earthquakes\nthat clarify and sharpen. Events are in much sharper relief." Like Bush,\nshe said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons\nof mass destruction "in the hands of irresponsible states" now define the\nnational interest. (The latter goal, by the way, is new-in Bush\'s speech to\nCongress on September 20th, America\'s sole grand purpose was ending\nterrorism.) We talked in her West Wing office; its tall windows face the\npart of the White House grounds where television reporters do their\nstandups. In her bearing, Rice seemed less crisply military than she does\nin public. She looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of\nmissionary calm, rather than belligerence.\n\nIn the Foreign Affairs article, Rice came across as a classic realist,\nputting forth "the notions of power politics, great powers, and power\nbalances" as the proper central concerns of the United States. Now she\nsounded as if she had moved closer to the one-power idea that Cheney\'s\nPentagon team proposed ten years ago-or, at least, to the idea that the\nother great powers are now in harmony with the United States, because of\nthe terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. "Theoretically, the\nrealists would predict that when you have a great power like the United\nStates it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to\nchallenge it or trying to balance against it," Rice said. "And I think what\nyou\'re seeing is that there\'s at least a predilection this time to move to\nproductive and coöperative relations with the United States, rather than to\ntry to balance the United States. I actually think that statecraft matters\nin how it all comes out. It\'s not all foreordained."\n\nRice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the\nNational Security Council and asked them to think seriously about "how do\nyou capitalize on these opportunities" to fundamentally change American\ndoctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of September 11th. "I\nreally think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947," she said-that is,\nthe period when the containment doctrine took shape-"in that the events so\nclearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it\'s a big\nglobal threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally\nthought of as being in the coalition. That has started shifting the\ntectonic plates in international politics. And it\'s important to try to\nseize on that and position American interests and institutions and all of\nthat before they harden again."\n\nThe National Security Council is legally required to produce an annual\ndocument called the National Security Strategy, stating the over-all goals\nof American policy-another government report whose importance is great but\nnot obvious. The Bush Administration did not produce one last year, as the\nClinton Administration did not in its first year. Rice said that she is\nworking on the report now.\n\n"There are two ways to handle this document," she told me. "One is to do it\nin a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. But it\'s our view that,\nsince this is going to be the first one for the Bush Administration, it\'s\nimportant. An awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior\nto 9/11. I can\'t give you a certain date when it\'s going to be out, but I\nwould think sometime this spring. And it\'s important that it be a real\nstatement of what the Bush Administration sees as the strategic direction\nthat it\'s going."\n\nIt seems clear already that Rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant\nAmerican role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. Some\nquestions that don\'t appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being\nasked, are how much the United States is willing to operate alone in\nforeign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender\ninside other countries-and to what end, and with what means. The leak a\ncouple of weeks ago of a new American nuclear posture, adding offensive\ncapability against "rogue states," departed from decades of official\nadherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of\nthe scope of the reconsideration that is going on. Is the United States now\nin a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the Middle East,\nand replacing governments by force? Nobody thought that the Bush\nAdministration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it\nis, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few\nmonths ago.\n\nJust before the 2000 election, a Republican foreign-policy figure suggested\nto me that a good indication of a Bush Administration\'s direction in\nforeign affairs would be who got a higher-ranking job, Paul Wolfowitz or\nRichard Haass. Haass is another veteran of the first Bush Administration,\nand an intellectual like Wolfowitz, but much more moderate. In 1997, he\npublished a book titled "The Reluctant Sheriff," in which he poked a little\nfun at Wolfowitz\'s famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he\ncalled it the "Pentagon Paper") and disagreed with its idea that the United\nStates should try to be the world\'s only great power over the long term.\n"For better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach," Haass wrote. "It\nsimply is not doable." Elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of\nthe Wolfowitz team\'s main ideas, that of the United States expanding the\n"democratic zone of peace": "Primacy is not to be confused with hegemony.\nThe United States cannot compel others to become more democratic." Haass\nargued that the United States is becoming less dominant in the world, not\nmore, and suggested "a revival of what might be called traditional\ngreat-power politics."\n\nWolfowitz got a higher-ranking job than Haass: he is Deputy Secretary of\nDefense, and Haass is Director of Policy Planning for the State Department-\nin effect, Colin Powell\'s big-think guy. Recently, I went to see him in his\noffice at the State Department. On the wall of his waiting room was an\narray of photographs of every past director of the policy-planning staff,\nbeginning with George Kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and\nthe first holder of the office that Haass now occupies.\n\nIt\'s another indication of the way things are moving in Washington that\nHaass seems to have become more hawkish. I mentioned the title of his book.\n"Using the word \'reluctant\' was itself reflective of a period when foreign\npolicy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case\nto make," he said. "It was written when Bill Clinton was saying, \'It\'s the\neconomy, stupid\'-not \'It\'s the world, stupid.\' Two things are very\ndifferent now. One, the President has a much easier time making the case\nthat foreign policy matters. Second, at the top of the national-security\ncharts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."\n\nI asked Haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as\nKennan\'s containment. "I think there is," he said. "What you\'re seeing from\nthis Administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of\nideas-I\'m not sure it constitutes a doctrine-about what you might call the\nlimits of sovereignty. Sovereignty entails obligations. One is not to\nmassacre your own people. Another is not to support terrorism in any way.\nIf a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of\nthe normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone\ninside your own territory. Other governments, including the United States,\ngain the right to intervene. In the case of terrorism, this can even lead\nto a right of preventive, or peremptory, self-defense. You essentially can\nact in anticipation if you have grounds to think it\'s a question of when,\nand not if, you\'re going to be attacked."\n\nClearly, Haass was thinking of Iraq. "I don\'t think the American public\nneeds a lot of persuading about the evil that is Saddam Hussein," he said.\n"Also, I\'d fully expect the President and his chief lieutenants to make the\ncase. Public opinion can be changed. We\'d be able to make the case that\nthis isn\'t a discretionary action but one done in self-defense."\n\nOn the larger issue of the American role in the world, Haass was still\nmaintaining some distance from the hawks. He had made a speech not long\nbefore called "Imperial America," but he told me that there is a big\ndifference between imperial and imperialist. "I just think that we have to\nbe a little bit careful," he said. "Great as our advantages are, there are\nstill limits. We have to have allies. We can\'t impose our ideas on\neveryone. We don\'t want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to\njoin us. American leadership, yes; but not American unilateralism. It has\nto be multilateral. We can\'t win the war against terror alone. We can\'t\nsend forces everywhere. It really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."\n\nHe stopped for a moment. "Is there a successor idea to containment? I think\nthere is," he said. "It is the idea of integration. The goal of U.S.\nforeign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to\ncertain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade,\ndemocracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies\nand then building institutions that lock them in even more."\n\nThe first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new\nAmerican foreign policy will be the effort to remove Saddam Hussein. What\nthe United States does in an Iraq operation will very likely dwarf what\'s\nbeen done so far in Afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the\noperation itself and in terms of its aftermath.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Ahmad Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress,\nthe Iraqi opposition party, came through Washington with an entourage of\nhis aides. Chalabi went to the State Department and the White House to ask,\nevidently successfully, for more American funding. His main public event\nwas a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. Chalabi\'s\nleading supporter in town, Richard Perle, the prominent hawk and former\nDefense Department official, acted as moderator. Smiling and supremely\nconfident, Perle opened the discussion by saying, "Evidence is mounting\nthat the Administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing\nwith Saddam Hussein." The war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete\n"until Saddam is successfully dealt with. And that means replacing his\nregime. . . . That action will be taken, I have no doubt."\n\nChalabi, who lives in London, is a charming, suave middle-aged man with a\ntwinkle in his eye. He was dressed in a double-breasted pin-striped suit\nand a striped shirt with a white spread collar. Although he and his\nsupporters argue that the Iraqi National Congress, with sufficient American\nsupport, can defeat Saddam just as the Northern Alliance defeated the\nTaliban in Afghanistan, this view hasn\'t won over most people in\nWashington. It isn\'t just that Chalabi doesn\'t look the part of a rebel\nmilitary leader ("He could fight you for the last petit four on the tray\nover tea at the Savoy, but that\'s about it," one skeptical former Pentagon\nofficial told me), or that he isn\'t in Iraq. It\'s also that Saddam\'s\nmilitary is perhaps ten times the size that the Taliban\'s was, and has been\nquite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. The United\nStates left Iraq in 1991 believing that Saddam might soon fall to an\ninternal rebellion; Chalabi\'s supporters believe that Saddam is much weaker\nnow, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could\nfinish him off. But non-true believers seem to be coming around to the idea\nthat a military operation against Saddam would mean the deployment of\nanywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand American ground\ntroops.\n\nKenneth Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst who was the National Security\nCouncil\'s staff expert on Iraq during the last years of the Clinton\nAdministration, recently caused a stir in the foreign-policy world by\npublishing an article in Foreign Affairs calling for war against Saddam.\nThis was noteworthy because three years ago Pollack and two co-authors\npublished an article, also in Foreign Affairs, arguing that the Iraqi\nNational Congress was incapable of defeating Saddam. Pollack still doesn\'t\nthink Chalabi can do the job. He believes that it would require a\nsubstantial American ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one\nwe used in Kuwait in 1990-91 than to the one we are using now in\nAfghanistan.\n\nPollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a\nbriefing or two in his day. When I went to see him at his office in\nWashington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and\nwalked over to his office wall, where three maps of the Middle East were\nhanging. "The only way to do it is a full-scale invasion," he said, using a\npen as a pointer. "We\'re talking about two grand corps, two to three\nhundred thousand people altogether. The population is here, in the\nTigris-Euphrates valley." He pointed to the area between Baghdad and Basra.\n"Ideally, you\'d have the Saudis on board." He pointed to the Prince Sultan\nairbase, near Riyadh. "You could make Kuwait the base, but it\'s much easier\nin Saudi. You need to take western Iraq and southern Iraq"-pointing\nagain-"because otherwise they\'ll fire Scuds at Israel and at the Saudi oil\nfields. You probably want to prevent Iraq from blowing up its own oil\nfields, so troops have to occupy them. And you need troops to defend the\nKurds in northern Iraq." Point, point. "You go in as hard as you can, as\nfast as you can." He slapped his hand on the top of his desk. "You get the\nenemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once." His\nhand hit the desk again, hard. "Then you crush him." Smack.\n\nThat would be a reverberating blow. The United States has already removed\nthe government of one country, Afghanistan, the new government is obviously\nshaky, and American military operations there are not completed. Pakistan,\nwhich before September 11th clearly met the new test of national\nunacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass\ndestruction), will also require long-term attention, since the country is\nnot wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of Daniel\nPearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence\nservice, may not be entirely under the control of the President. In Iraq,\nif America invades and brings down Saddam, a new government must be\nestablished-an enormous long-term task in a country where there is no\nobvious, plausible new leader. The prospective Iraq operation has drawn\nstrong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, Russia, is a\nnuclear superpower. An invasion would have a huge effect on the internal\naffairs of all the biggest Middle Eastern nations: Iran, Turkey, Saudi\nArabia, and even Egypt. Events have forced the Administration to become\ndirectly involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it hadn\'t wanted\nto do. So it\'s really the entire region that is in play, in much the way\nthat Europe was immediately after the Second World War.\n\nIn September, Bush rejected Paul Wolfowitz\'s recommendation of immediate\nmoves against Iraq. That the President seems to have changed his mind is an\nindication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the Administration\'s\nconservatives. "These guys are relentless," one former official, who is\nclose to the high command at the State Department, told me. "Resistance is\nfutile." The conservatives\' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is\nintellectualism. Colin Powell tends to think case by case, and since\nSeptember 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least\nthe beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance\npractically requires invading Iraq. If the United States applies the\ndoctrines of Cheney\'s old Pentagon team, "shaping" and expanding "the zone\nof democracy," the implications would extend far beyond that one operation.\n\nThe outside experts on the Middle East who have the most credibility with\nthe Administration seem to be Bernard Lewis, of Princeton, and Fouad Ajami,\nof the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, both of whom\nsee the Arab Middle East as a region in need of radical remediation. Lewis\nwas invited to the White House in December to brief the senior\nforeign-policy staff. "One point he made is, Look, in that part of the\nworld, nothing matters more than resolute will and force," the senior\nofficial I had lunch with told me-in other words, the United States needn\'t\nproceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the "Arab street," as long as it is\nprepared to be strong. The senior official also recommended as interesting\nthinkers on the Middle East Charles Hill, of Yale, who in a recent essay\ndeclared, "Every regime of the Arab-Islamic world has proved a failure,"\nand Reuel Marc Gerecht, of the American Enterprise Institute, who published\nan article in The Weekly Standard about the need for a change of regime in\nIran and Syria. (Those goals, Gerecht told me when we spoke, could be\naccomplished through pressure short of an invasion.)\n\nSeveral people I spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the\nnations that loudly oppose an invasion of Iraq would privately cheer it on,\nif they felt certain that this time the Americans were really going to\nfinish the job. One purpose of Vice-President Cheney\'s recent diplomatic\ntour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely\nabsorbing all the public criticism of an Iraq operation. In any event, the\nAdministration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of\nthe world\'s approval. When I spoke to Condoleezza Rice, she said that the\nUnited States should assemble "coalitions of the willing" to support its\nactions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure\nof international treaties and organizations. An invasion of Iraq would test\nthat policy in more ways than one: the Administration would be betting that\nit can continue to eliminate Al Qaeda cells in countries that publicly\nopposed the Iraq operation.\n\nWhen the Administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked\nfor a forty-eight-billion-dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal\n2003, which begins in October, 2002. Much of that sum would go to improve\nmilitary pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as\nan unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on\nterrorism. That\'s probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of\nIraq.\n\nThis spring, the Administration will be talking to other countries about\nthe invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while Bush\nbuilds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the\nunacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. A drama\ninvolving weapons inspections in Iraq will play itself out over the spring\nand summer, and will end with the United States declaring that the terms\nthat Saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions,\nare unacceptable. Then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the\nenormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. The\nAdministration obviously feels confident that the United States can\neffectively parry whatever aggressive actions Saddam takes during the troop\nbuildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize Iraq enough to cause the\nRepublican Guard, the military key to the country, to turn against Saddam\nand topple him on its own. But the chain of events leading inexorably to a\nfull-scale American invasion, if it hasn\'t already begun, evidently will\nbegin soon.\n\nLewis (Scooter) Libby, who was the principal drafter of Cheney\'s\nfuture-of-the-world documents during the first Bush Administration, now\nworks in an office in the Old Executive Office Building, overlooking the\nWest Wing, where he has a second, smaller office. A packet of\npublic-relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of\nhis 1996 novel, "The Apprentice," quotes the Times\' calling him "Dick\nCheney\'s Dick Cheney," which seems like an apt description: he appears\nabsolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of\nthe influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly\nrumble. Like Condoleezza Rice and Bush himself, he gives the impression of\nhaving calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction\nwhich the Administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for\nthose charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only\ntruly prudent course.\n\nWhen I went to see Libby, not long ago, I asked him whether, before\nSeptember 11th, American policy toward terrorism should have been\ndifferent. He went to his desk and got out a large black loose-leaf binder,\nfilled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the Middle\nEast. He looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer.\n\n"Let us stack it up," he said at last. "Somalia, 1993; 1994, the discovery\nof the Al Qaeda-related plot in the Philippines; 1993, the World Trade\nCenter, first bombing; 1993, the attempt to assassinate President Bush,\nformer President Bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a\nserious response to that; 1995, the Riyadh bombing; 1996, the Khobar\nbombing; 1998, the Kenyan embassy bombing and the Tanzanian embassy\nbombing; 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks; 2000, the bombing of\nthe Cole. Throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the Iraqis,\nand eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime; and the\nfailure to respond significantly to Iraqi incursions in the Kurdish areas.\nNo one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that\nlong list and you ask, \'Did we respond in a way which discouraged people\nfrom supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our\ninterests? Did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged\nfurther aggressions against U.S. interests?,\' many observers conclude no,\nand ask whether it was then easier for someone like Osama bin Laden to rise\nup and say credibly, \'The Americans don\'t have the stomach to defend\nthemselves. They won\'t take casualties to defend their interests. They are\nmorally weak.\' "\n\nLibby insisted that the American response to September 11th has not been\nstandard or foreordained. "Look at what the President has done in\nAfghanistan," he said, "and look at his speech to the joint session of\nCongress"-meaning the State of the Union Message, in January. "He made it\nclear that it\'s an important area. He made it clear that we believe in\nexpanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world.\nHe made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. And\nhe had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to\nbegin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is\nnot a change of behavior on their part. Take the Afghan case, for example.\nThere are many other courses that the President could have taken. He could\nhave waited for juridical proof before we responded. He could have engaged\nin long negotiations with the Taliban. He could have failed to seek a new\nrelationship with Pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so\nafraid of weakening Pakistan that we didn\'t seek its help. This list could\ngo on to twice or three times the length I\'ve mentioned so far. But,\ninstead, the President saw an opportunity to refashion relations while\nstanding up for our interests. The problem is complex, and we don\'t know\nyet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not\nonly with Afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the\nstates of Central Asia, Pakistan, Russia, and, as it may develop, with the\nstates of Southwest Asia more generally."\n\nWe moved on to Iraq, and the question of what makes Saddam Hussein\nunacceptable, in the Administration\'s eyes. "The issue is not inspections,"\nLibby said. "The issue is the Iraqis\' promise not to have weapons of mass\ndestruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of Kuwait, their\npromise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made\nin \'91, and a number of U.N. resolutions, including all the other problems\nI listed. Whether it was wise or not-and that is the subject of debate-Iraq\nwas given a second chance to abide by international norms. It failed to\ntake that chance then, and annually for the next ten years."\n\n"What\'s your level of confidence," I asked him, "that the current regime\nwill, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"\n\nHe ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke\nslowly and deliberately. "There is no basis in Iraq\'s past behavior to have\nconfidence in good-faith efforts on their part to change their behavior."\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR. A.

Some recent research points worth mentioning:\n\nRecent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\ntemperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\ncorrelation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\nare not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\nincrease in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\npreceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\nof the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\ncorrelated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\ncausative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a\nfairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an\nauthoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.\n\nWith respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\npoint out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\nregular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle\npeaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this\ncycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete\ncyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and\ntime), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it\nhappens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\ncyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other\nwords, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we\nwould be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\nrecord.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\nconcentrations.\n\nAlso, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\naffects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\npredictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\nfeedback systems mentioned above.\n\nLast, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\nmakes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\nmethane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\nbasis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\nthat CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\nbiosphere.\n\nCO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\nstudies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\npassenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't\nthink it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in\nunderstanding warming trends.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But the energy\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\n\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\nand fiscal mess we\'ll be cleaning up for decades, we\'re learning what\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\n\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\'s finding by a federal\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\nCalifornia\'s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\nalso driving up prices.\n\nAnd don\'t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\'s boast in a\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\ncongestion.\'\'\n\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\nseen. Unfortunately, California\'s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\'t been sufficient.\n\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\'\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\'s foolish to think\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\n\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\'s a\nreasonable approach, but don\'t expect miracles.\n\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\'\'\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\n\nIt\'s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\'s genuine competition, as we could\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\ninject real competition into the market.\n\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\nis essential.\n\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\nboth.\n\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\'s utilities\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\n\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\nideas isn\'t enough.\n\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\n\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\'t\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\nreact to last year\'s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\'s\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\naltogether.\n\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\'s energy policies, so\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\nmaking us all more vulnerable.

'\n\nOK, let\'s bring some data into the discussion:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm\n(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature\nfluctuations over the past 400k years).\n\n> Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\n> temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\n> correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\n> are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\n> increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\n> preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\n> of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\n> correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\n> causative.\n\nBased on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation\nbetween temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn\'t always appear to\nbe causal.\n\n> With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\n> point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\n> regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.\n\nAlso correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.\n\n> As it\n> happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\n> cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.\n\nNot correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and\n<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2\nconcentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded\nvalue from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing\nat 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the\nVostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn\'t capable of such fine\nresolution).\n\n> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,\n\nNo, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:\nhttp://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm\n(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the "historical record").\n\nNot only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok\nrecord, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.\nThere is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for\nanthropogenic input. You\'re really out on the fringe if you\'re debating\nthis -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.\n\n> but it looks a lot like we\n> would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\n> record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\n> concentrations.\n\nWrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past\n400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly\nspike, and then return back to "normal" background levels (and hence the\nspike might not show up in the ice cores).\n\nStill, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that\neven you would have a hard time arguing away.\n\n> Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\n> affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\n> predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\n> feedback systems mentioned above.\n\nYes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a\nfinite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn\'t increase,\nbut we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be\nenormous.\n\n> Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn\'t particularly potent, although it\n> makes up for it in volume in some cases.

Another clearly\nanthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I\'m in favor of reductions in\nmethane levels as well.\n\nData on water vapor here:\nhttp://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html\n\n> CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\n> studies and data I\'ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\n> passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.\n\nI tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in\nreducing global warming.

Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense\n(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve\nreductions in lifestyle to a "sustainable" level are unrealistic --\nAmericans just won\'t do it (you\'d be surprised at the number of climate\nchange researchers driving SUVs).

'\n\n\nI wanted to get back to this but didn\'t have the time.  I actually lived on\na couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest\nand also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my\nparents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than\nI have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I\ndo get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand\nfrom my father.\n\nThe income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because\nit is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it\nis true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a\nconsequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not\nsomething that was impressed upon them.\n\nThe primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity\nthat exists separately from the individuals, typically an "Indian\nCorporation" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a\nsingle share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from\ntribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the\ntribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per\nperson, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of\nplaces, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov\'t and various\nbusinesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.\n\nYou have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes\nare run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their\nshare no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very\nhigh unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy\ntake their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the\ncorporation often constitutes their sole "income" for government accounting\npurposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one\nworks, they\'ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those\ndividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because\nthey have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is\nthat on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,\nmany of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white\nfolk, not Indians.\n\nSecond, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also\nreceive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation\nto the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By\nbenefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other\nordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.\n\nIt should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are\nineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are\nvery smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good\ncredentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the\nHaida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has\nbillions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have\ngross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the\ndividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular\ncase, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before\ndrawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to\nintelligent investment and use.  They don\'t eat their seed corn, and have\nactually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,\nthere is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50\nmillion annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal\ngovernment with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This\nparticular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures\nper person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many\nborrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,\nthe people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand\ndollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather\nthan their own pockets.\n\nSomewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable\nassets to these tribes when they\'ve burned through the ones previously given\nwhere feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign\ncompanies.  And the cycle continues.\n\nSo what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a\nnutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.\n\nFew women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and\ngross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during\npregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very\nsubstantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of\nthe thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the\nearliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one\nreservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of\nthese societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is\narbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police\netc).\n\nIn short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a\nshambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I\nhave ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren\'t\nthat many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I\ncould tell you that I\'ve seen that you probably would not believe unless\nyou\'d seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but\nit has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good\nguys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,\nif any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as\na minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are\nopenly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It\nwill give you an interesting perspective on things.)\n\nThere are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous\nIndians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and\nintelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is\nwhere the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if\nthey maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal\nleaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological\ncases mentioned above.\n\nThe Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent\nby the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high\nwhen you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is\njust that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to\nordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The\npoverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my\noriginal point.\n\n\nOn a tangent:\n\nOne thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal\ncorporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate\nsocialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this\nstructure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has\ninterested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well\nover the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.\n\nIt seems that in a future where "familial" ties will be increasingly\nvoluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western\nsociety, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with\nthe included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting\nindividuals.\n\nDamn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com \n\n\n\nOn 9/22/02 3:53 PM, "John Hall" <johnhall@evergo.net> wrote:\n> \n> As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans\n> who speak english at home and those who do not.

'\n\nI attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that\nJim didn\'t mention.

Some took for\ngranted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it\njust as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore\nXML almost completely. \n\nI attended realizing that "content management" is generally used to\napply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how\ncompletely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration\nof the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the\noccasional "...and you can use FOP to make PDF" as if that was\nfunctional): this seems more the case in open source content management\nthan in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to\nignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).\n\nThe honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of\ncurrent tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I\'d written\ndown what he said, something like "it sucks so extremely, it sucks so\nwidely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is\nno hope." For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial\nsystems scaled so well that the commercial "big boys" were really much\nmore functional than open source, until someone pointed out, "OK, take\nsome average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it\'ll scale\npretty well."

There\'s good design and bad design. \nThere\'s good testing and bad testing.  The problem\nis, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody\ndoes.  I think "best practices" hasn\'t caught up\non main street Web enablement yet.  There\'s some\nreally great packages on how to do this stuff and\nin fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed\nto be fixed 5 years ago, so that\'s why we got XForms\nand  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and\npeople usually do.  What the problem is, they don\'t\neven recognize that they\'re gimpy--ever.  They just\nkeeping trundling along making a mess of everything\nassured in their job security that they can build\nWeb forms without even caring if they can be\nused or not beyond their test machine.\n\nIf you had a piece of software and a security warning\ncame out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?\nWouldn\'t you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally\nbroken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know\nis why would someone use Web forms best practices from\n5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that\ntime.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows\nor Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window\nmanager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for\na brief period of time, but they are completely useless\nexcept for some terminal based replacement applications. \n\nThe bottom line is, if you can\'t get across the\nbridge, then it\'s broken regardless of whose fault\nit really is, and it\'s the business that \nneeds to take responsibility as they are the ones that\nwanted to put the bridge there in the first place. \n\n\nGreg\n\n\n'

It includes computer calculations that\nhave produced a series of three-dimensional images of the\ncrumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,\nhelping to identify the sequence of failures that led to\nthe collapses. \n\nAn immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the\ndebris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been\naccumulated in a collection that far outstrips what\ngovernment analysts have been able to put together as they\nstruggle to answer the scientifically complex and\nemotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly\nfailures of the buildings. \n\nBut everyone from structural engineers to relatives of\nvictims fear that the closely held information, which\nincludes the analysis and the possible answers that\nfamilies and engineers around the world have craved, may\nremain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. \n\nBound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the\nexperts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they\nwait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are\ntypical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it\nnow stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that\ncertain material can remain secret for the time being - has\napproved standard legal arrangements that, should the\nlawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial\nmaterial generated by the competing sides to be withheld. \n\n"We\'re obviously in favor of releasing the information, but\nwe can\'t until we\'re told what to do," said Matthys Levy,\nan engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,\nwho is a consultant in the case and the author of "Why\nBuildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail" (Norton, 2nd\nedition, 2002). \n\n"Let\'s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole\nprocess" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. \n\nMonica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the\nsouth tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper\nSafety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.\n"If they have answers and are not going to share them, I\nwould be devastated," Mrs. Gabrielle said. "They have a\nmoral obligation." \n\nThe lawsuit that has generated the information involves\nLarry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the\ntrade center property, and a consortium of insurance\ncompanies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner\nthat hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist\nattack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half\nthat amount, as the insurance companies say. \n\nAs both sides have prepared their arguments, they have\nspent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert\nopinion about exactly what happened to the towers. \n\nDean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of\nHartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said\nof the findings, "There are some confidentiality agreements\nthat are keeping those out of the public domain today." He\nconceded that differing opinions among the more than 20\ninsurers on his side of the case could complicate any\nrelease of the material. \n\nAs for his own company, whose consultants alone have\nproduced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of\ndiagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt\nwould be made to give the material eventually to "public\nauthorities and investigative teams." \n\nStill, some of that analysis relies on information like\nblueprints and building records from other sources, like\nthe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built\nand owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in\nthe suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the\ndiffering origins of the material would influence his\ncompany\'s ability to release information. \n\nIn a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents\nwould be "decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with\napplicable law and policy," adding that it would cooperate\nwith "federal investigations." \n\nThe fate of the research is particularly critical to\nresolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,\ngiven the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into\nthe buildings\' collapse. That investigation, led by the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few\nresources, a lack of access to crucial information like\nbuilding plans, and infighting among experts and officials.\nA new federal investigation intended to remedy those\nfailings has just begun at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has\nstudied many building disasters. \n\nOfficials with NIST have said it could take years to make\nfinal determinations and recommendations for other\nbuildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded\nup with access to the analysis done by the consultants on\nthe lawsuit. \n\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of\nthe real estate executive\'s own heavily financed\ninvestigative work, "We decline to comment other than to\nsay that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST\ninvestigation." A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was\nin discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but\nsaid no transfer had taken place. \n\nWith no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by\nboth sides in the legal case have produced a startling body\nof science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the\ntrade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. \n\n"The work should be available to other investigators," said\nRamon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner\nat Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier\ninquiry. "It could be used to build better buildings in the\nfuture." \n\nLegal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one\ngoverning the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,\nfrom full or partial disclosure to destruction of such\ninformation. In some cases, litigants who paid for the\nreports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to\nhave them sealed forever. \n"It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep\nsome of those documents secret for one reason or another,\nsome legitimate, some not," said Lee Levine, a First\nAmendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. \n\nMr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the\ninformation, the court might look favorably on requests to\nmake it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the\nmaterial is unnerving to many people, especially experts\nwho believe that only a complete review of the evidence -\nnot piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect\ntheir own interests - could lead to an advance in the\nfederal investigation of the trade center. \n\n"It\'s important for this to get presented and published and\nsubjected to some scrutiny," said Dr. John Osteraas,\ndirector of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure\nAnalysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the\ncase, "because then the general engineering community can\nsort it out." \n\nThe scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by\nany measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger\nAssociates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called\nupon powerful computer programs, originally developed with\nthe Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of\nthe Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. \n\nThe result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of\nthe severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged\ncore of the towers, beginning with the impacts and\nproceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -\nwhich Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped\npinpoint the structural failures. \n\nThe FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer\nmodeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to\nthe trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks\nimmediately after the attacks. But no such constraints\nhampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to\nthe site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of\nSept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a\nconsultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he\nhad assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground\nzero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how\nthe towers fell. \n\nThough the FEMA team could not determine "where things\nactually fell," Mr. Cuoco said, "we\'ve indicated the\nspecific locations." \n\nMr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details\nof the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details\nof computer calculations his company has done on the spread\nof fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.\nOsteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of\nphotographs and videos of the towers that day, some of\nwhich he believes have not been available to other\ninvestigators. \n\nAnd the investigation has not limited itself to computers\nand documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind\ntunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining\nthe aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed\nthe weakening structures. \n\nJack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort\nCollins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but\nhad previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the\noriginal design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For\nthe legal case, Dr. Cermak said, "we\'ve done probably more\ndetailed measurements than in the original design." \n\n"The data that have been acquired are very valuable in\nthemselves for understanding how wind and buildings\ninteract," Dr. Cermak said. "Some of the information may be\nvaluable for the litigation," he said, adding, "I think\nI\'ve told you all I can."\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/30/nyregion/30TOWE.html?ex=1034388663&ei=1&en=0d3143a997e5e2e1\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n'

It is\npart of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  \n\nFor comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more\nserious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain\nWest.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable\nprotest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if\nheated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the\nlocal population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests\nI\'ve seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually\nfacing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are\nprotesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets\nresults.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses\nand restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known\nto be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very\neffective at forcing dialog.  I don\'t recall anyone characterizing their\nprotests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n'

IMHO.\n\nBS> Bill\n\n\nNo offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a\nsign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.\n\nMy sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more\nto this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the\ngross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't\nthe most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it\nwas.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to\nthe representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the\npeople doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't\nsupport the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin\nPowell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that\nthis is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a\nright to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the\nfolks they elected in the first place.\n\nMy point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases\nsuch as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts\nwe have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He\nhas a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the\nrepresentatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.\n\nI think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original\nthread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming\ndissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in\nhaving broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the\npolicy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the\nscreaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from\nthe folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,\noffensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply\ndue to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My\ngeneration never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,\nwe just dont' know it all.\n\nI hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:\n\nScreaming != Free speech on all cases.\nDissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by\nthe Supremes.\n\nK?\n\n-- \nBest regards,\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\n\n\n"

'\n\nOne of the most bizarre pages I\'ve seen on the Web. At first I thought it\nmight be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody\nbelieves this.\n\n===\nhttp://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm\n\nM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\nDINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\ntheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\nRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\ntogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\nderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\nThe Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\nwith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\ndescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\nthem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\nnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\neven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\nrenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\nThe definitive work on dragons is "The Flight of Dragons" by Peter\nDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\nbow. Targets do not come much bigger.\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer\'s current scenario is that\nthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\ntheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\nsurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\nThey evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\n(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\nbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\n\nThus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\ndinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\nto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\nviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\ncontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\nencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\nmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\nso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\ndifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people\'s dinosaurs should remove\nall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\nSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\nif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\nall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\npsi.\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\nhold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\n\nDinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\nrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\nhatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\nthem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\nkeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\nthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\nact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\nability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\nso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\nbecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\n\nBirds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\nthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\nonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\nto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\nprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\nsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\nAntarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\neven if they are standing on ice.\n\nMammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\nof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\ncan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\nsitting on a nest.\n\nDinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\nwhile birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\nall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\n\nIf one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\npurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\nreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\nregardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\nconcentrate on "How to Brainwash your Neighbour". Conscious thought has\nbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\n"How to care for and protect one\'s young" as a foundation.\n\nThus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something "A load of\ndinosaur\'s eggs". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur\'s eggs of any entity\ntends to purge all malice back to its roots.\n\nIt looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\naided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\nvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\nserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\n\nITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\ncontrol or ownership of the target\'s psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\nfollowing.\n\nNest of dinosaur\'s eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\nEggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\nhormones, abilities, etc.\nMind machines.\nThe original engraving or engram.\nGOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\nhey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\nfirst job holders.\nTIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\ntime.\n\nMy, our, Man\'s timetracks, etc.\nThe time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\nSubconscious, etc.\nEXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\nTheir virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\none hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\nhigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\nother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\nEvery extinct race, etc.\nBLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\ngenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\nEvery blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\n\n\n'

I think the\nlaws specialing out hate and protected speech\nare ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make\nis that there\'s only two types, speech and action. \nI agree, they are all speech and should be \ncovered by the First Amendment, but\n\nIf hate speech is so protected, why are certain\nstates trying to prosecute people for it?  There\'s\nonly two answers and one of them is wrong.\n\n  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to\n     have a different level of protection dictated\n     by whoever\'s offended at the time.\n  2) It\'s because it\'s not just speech, but action.\n     A action who\'s consequences are foreseeable by \n     any reasonable person. \n\nHate speech is mislabeled.  It\'s really "threat".  I think\nthey let the mislabeling perpetuate as there\'s advantage\nin being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and\nmoney through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY\ndon\'t like.  \n\n\nGreg\n\n\n\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> Join the world?s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail.\n> http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n'

'\n\n\nOver on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article\nthat goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and\nrespect for its users.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html\n\nThere is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at\nhttp://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html\n\n"True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain\na competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in\ntheir applications. Apple\'s private menu extras APIs were reverse\nengineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular\nthat an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third\nparty or otherwise) was in development.\n\nAll of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the\nprivate APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\nplace.\n\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.\nBut when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of\n"known" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it\nis not allowed to load.\n\nIt\'s easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer\'s sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants\n"developers, developers, developers!", but Microsoft clearly understands\nsomething that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform\nvendor\'s best interest to encourage development for its platform. In\nApple\'s case, this doesn\'t mean that they have to bend over backwards to\nmake every single system service and UI element "pluggable" via public\nAPIs. That\'s clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the\nnumber one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if\nthird party developers want to sell into a market that requires the\ndesired functionality to be added in "unsupported" ways, then they must be\nprepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.\n\nBut for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer\neffort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to\nprovide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish.

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\n\nOctober 2, 2002\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \n\n\n\n\n \n\nApparently it fell into the category "too good to check."\n\n\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\nprogram "Good Morning America," and on Saturday by CNN. \n\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\nsubject. \n\n"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\noriginated," said the organization, an agency of the United\nNations based in Geneva, "but would like to stress that we\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds." \n\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - "a\nblonde-shell study," as The Daily Star of London put it.\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \n\nOn "Good Morning America," Charles Gibson began a\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\n"There\'s a study from the World Health Organization, this\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\nbrunets." \n\nMs. Sawyer said she was "somewhat of a natural blonde."\n\n\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \n\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \n\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\nendangered species. \n\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\nremained unclear which one. \n\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\nBritain\'s domestic news agency. "Several papers picked it\nup," he said. \n\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\nto the World Health Organization. \n\n"We didn\'t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\nWorld Health Organization first," she said. "They told us\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\nGerman news agency." \n\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\norganization was referring to. \n\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\nblond hair "sounds patently incorrect."\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \nhelp@nytimes.com.  \n\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\n\n\n'

'\n\n\nWell it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to\nthe new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of\ndieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the\nnext few weeks..\n\nIn preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core\nfor the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless\nap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop\n\nI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the\ncard, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether\nhub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the\nwebinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some\nmore (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)\nbut all in all a smooth move.\n\n\nNow the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of\nfunky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,\nessentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get\ngoofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between\nthe AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting\n11mbs and at least 60% goodness.\n\n\nSome cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works\ninthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a\nmicrowave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear\ncat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad\nthing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I\nhope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )\n\nOk, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed\nby vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is\nheading this way....DUCKKKKK\n\n\n(1)http://www.linksys.com/Products/product.asp?grid=23&prid=173\n\n\n'

'\n\ndraw the pain\n\n"Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in\nworkshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You\ndraw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take\nabout 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully\nlistening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts\nand where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of\nthis the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to\nimagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay."\n\nWorks!  There\'s this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle\nfinger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found\nthe boundary, and repeated the motion.

Thus, my book\nPrinciples of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching\nmethods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.\nPerhaps you\nhave also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune\nbuggy, etc.). \n\nThese analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps\'\' to enhance our creativity, but\nthey\ncannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must\nbe\nbased on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. \n\nIn this essay I\'ll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks\non a\nbook about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many\ndifferences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer\nrather\ndirectly. \n\nAccording to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call\n``the\nthree E\'s\'\': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,\nwhich\nBillington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S\'s). We will consider each in\nturn. \n\n\nEfficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used\n\nIn structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety\nand the\nissues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language\ndesign,\nefficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where\nefficiency\nconsiderations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming\nLanguages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing\ntime, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was\nprogrammer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN\'s\nimplicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed\nfor the\nsake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). \n\nEfficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we\nare\nnot comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as\nprogrammer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are\nreduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now\nturn. \n\n\nEconomy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost\n\nWhereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks\nto\nmaximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges\nare\nusually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public\'\'\nthat\nmust be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these\nprogrammers work. \n\nEconomic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,\nthe shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost\nof\ncomputer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the\nincreasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of\nprogram\nmaintenance compared to program development. \n\nOther social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major\nmanufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some\nway\nby influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether\nit\ncomes to be perceived as a ``real\'\' language (used by ``real programmers\'\') or as a ``toy\'\' language (used by\nnovices\nor dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are\nfrequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming\nlanguage. \n\nOften economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are\noften\nunstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from\ndissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately\nrepresented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost\'\' and ``benefit\'\' must be considered\nin\nseeking an economical design. \n\n\nElegance Symbolizes Good Design\n\n``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?\'\' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the\ncritical\nrole of elegance in ``hard-nosed\'\' engineering. \n\nFor the Designer\n\nIt is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the\ndifficulty\nof analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).\nStructural\nengineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don\'t\nmake\nextensive use of computer models and calculation. \n\nOne reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which\nvariables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this\ndecision is not\nmade well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this\nis\nanother potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical\nanalysis\nmay overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of\nsafety is\nadditional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). \n\nSimilarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a\nchoice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an\nover-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. \n\nMany people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it\nvibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.\nBillington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a\nconsequence of\nan increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed\nthe\nTacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided\nby aesthetic principles. \n\nAccording to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do\nnot\nabandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because\nsolutions to\nstructural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible\nsolutions to a\nparticular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention\nto\ndesigns in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are\nunbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. \n\nThe general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can\nbe\nguided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea\nby\ninverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds\n(p.\n21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.\'\' In other words, the choice of\nform is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and\neconomical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. \n\nThe same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the\ninteraction\nof features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our\naesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having\nto\ncheck all the possible interactions. \n\nFor the User\n\nIn this case, what\'s good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge\nthat\nlooks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which\nfeatures may ``explode\'\' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed\nbridge\ngives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should\nreinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the\nconsequences\nof our actions. \n\nWe accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to\nsustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won\'t much matter that it was beautiful on the\noutside.\nSo also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation\nof a\ndeep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their\n(unwarranted)\nconfidence. \n\nIn summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a\nconsequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or\nprogramming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited\nvalue unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the\npreceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: \n                                The Elegance Principle\n\n              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. \n\n\n\nThe Programming Language as Work Environment\n\nThere are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming\nlanguage is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable\nand\nsafe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that\ntake\nplace within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? \n\nA programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer\'s\nfatigue\nand frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,\nencouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines\'\' and work as a\nnatural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine\'\' by encouraging\nthe programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming\nlanguage should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. \n\nThrough its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of\nits features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may\nrepresent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming\nlanguage can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by\nneglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.\nOut of\nsight, out of mind. \n\n\nAcquiring a Sense of Elegance\n\nAesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined\nsense\nof elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive\nexperience\nin design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.\nBecause of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each\ncompetition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public\nalso\ncritiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along\nwith that of the designers. \n\nSo also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -\nand criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people\'s designs\nand try\nto improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing\'\'\ncomes\nalong. \n\n\nReferences\n\n   1.Billington, David P., The Tower and the Bridge: The New Art of Structural Engineering, Princeton:\n     Princeton University Press, 1983.

Some of this has to\ndo with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I\nwas last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting\nsomething like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over\nseveral distinct issues.\n\nThe problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse\nthat is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their\ninterests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in\nOttawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to\nOttawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token\nrepresentation in the federal government.  While I\'m not clear on\nexactly how the government works up there, representation is not\nentirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern\nprovinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have\nsubstantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire\nprovince of Alberta.  \n\nThe long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta\nas a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so\nmuch as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the\nsparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having\nfewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less\nrestricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like\nhaving restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,\nAlberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is\nessentially a much worse version of what is happening in the\ninter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of\nCanada would really be hurting if they weren\'t receiving all those tax\ndollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.\n\nI have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I\'m not totally\nclear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial\nunfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I\'m a little\nfuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the\nAlbertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and\nthe sentiment has been getting worse over the years.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n'
'\n\nWhy am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of \ntoday’s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by \ncentralization.\n\nGenerically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one \nanswer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate \nagents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific \ncontext of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid \nvalue at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) \naccording to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more \nslowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the \nbasis for today’s most popular architectural style for developing \nnetwork applications: client-server interaction using request-response \ncommunication protocols.\n\nI believe these are profound limitations, which we are already \nencountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the \nbeholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the \nseparate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, \nunfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a \ncentralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a \nthird example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as \nabstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these \nlimits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and \ncommunication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light \nand human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized \ninformation representation, and hence centralized software architecture.\n\n\n'
"\n\nSpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\nOwen\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm\n\nInternet can level the political playing field\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\n\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one \nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping \nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \nask for our votes.\n\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\n\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\n\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\n\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \nthrough any of those channels.\n\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\n\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\n\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\n\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\n\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\n\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \ngroups.\n\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \nadvocacy management and communications software company.

Bush is dumb"\nstory has been taken up by those who like their caricatures\ndrawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that\nemerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,\nBritain\'s Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France\'s President\nJacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,\nthe decline of the French economy. "The problem with the\nFrench," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don\'t\nhave a word for entrepreneur."\n\nThe source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness\nWilliams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" had\nrecently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.\n\nLloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness\nWilliams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did\nreceive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair\'s director of\ncommunications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime\nminister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly\nnever told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"\nCampbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must\nhave been a joke."\n\nThis is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of\na jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than\nstellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories\ntoo hard, we can come up with three other instances we\'ve\nchronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the\nmoment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the\nranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged\nas the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the\nintelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus\nquatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win\nthe 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it\nwas the story of Bush\'s waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks\nto chortling up their sleeves.\n\nStories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual\nshortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they\nseemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this\npublic figure, that he\'s not the brightest fellow that\'s ever\nbeen. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at\nsome level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always\nfall upon appreciative ears.\n\nBarbara "ears of corn" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated:   29 July 2002\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n'

'\n\nNo analysis yet... don\'t know what to make of it yet. But here\'s the raw \nbits for all to peruse and check out what\'s really going on... Best, \nRohit\n\n===========================================================\n\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\nBy\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\'s device processes the data in \nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \naccording to company officials.\n\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \ndata.\n\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \nbusinesses.\n\n"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. \n"The XA35 is the first of a family."\n\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \nalternative.\n\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \nimportance in the world of XML.\n\n"Today\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly \nsaid. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \nFirewalls are blind to XML today."\n\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n\n"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, \nadding that to his knowledge no other company\'s solution does. Kelly \nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \nwill be mostly false.\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \nas they pass through the device.\n\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \ncontrols the device.\n\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \ndesigned the industry\'s first solutions to address the unique \nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\n\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\'s team raised the bar \nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \n2001, DataPower\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \nindustry\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\'s first wire-speed XML \nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of \nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \nindustry-leading customers and partners.\n\nDataPower\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, \ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n\n=========================================================================\n\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer \nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of \nDirectors.\n\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and \nsales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. \nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML \nnetworking\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions \nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on \nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.\n\n"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \nDataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \napplications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \nTechnology.\n\n"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web \nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single \nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \nservers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\n\n"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \nlaser-focused scrutiny.

Best, \nRohit\n\n===========================================================\n\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\nBy\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\n\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\'s device processes the data in \nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \naccording to company officials.\n\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\n\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\n\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \ndata.\n\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \nbusinesses.\n\n"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. \n"The XA35 is the first of a family."\n\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\n\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \nalternative.\n\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \nimportance in the world of XML.\n\n"Today\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly \nsaid. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \nFirewalls are blind to XML today."\n\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\n\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\n\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\n\n"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, \nadding that to his knowledge no other company\'s solution does. Kelly \nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \nwill be mostly false.\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\n\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\n\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\n\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\n\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \nas they pass through the device.\n\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\n\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\n\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \ncontrols the device.\n\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in\n\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\n\n========================================================================\n=\n\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \ndesigned the industry\'s first solutions to address the unique \nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\n\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\'s team raised the bar \nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \n2001, DataPower\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \nindustry\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\n\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\'s first wire-speed XML \nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of\n\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \nindustry-leading customers and partners.\n\nDataPower\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,\n\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\n\n========================================================================\n=\n\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\n\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer\n\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for \nthis round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed \nCapital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, \nand Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of \nDirectors.\n\nDataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and\n\nsales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.\n\nFounded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML \nnetworking\xa0devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions\n\nat the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services \nand other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on \nits patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.\n\n"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and \nintra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill \nprepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. \nDataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of \nXML that is required to support next generation enterprise \napplications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower \nTechnology.\n\n"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web\n\nservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single\n\nDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 \nservers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML \nprocessing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In \naddition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, \nprotection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of \ne-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing \nbetween back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.\n\n"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require \nlaser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses \na very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael \nTyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with \nDataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be \nfree to adopt next generation Web services without encountering \nperformance and security pitfalls."\n\n"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly\n\ngrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and \nsecurity," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on\n\ntheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML \nGeneration Three (XG3)\xa0technology was quite simply the single most \ncompelling technology solution we have seen to date."\n\n"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious \nabout optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been \ndeveloping solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web \nservices," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPower’s \nXML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely\n\non XML for mission critical applications."\n\nAbout Venrock Associates\nVenrock Associates was founded as the venture capital arm of the \nRockefeller Family and continues a tradition of funding entrepreneurs \nthat now spans over seven decades.

'\n\n From the local paper this morning.\n"Canadians eat about seven times as many doughnuts per capita"... (as \nAmericans) . D\'oh!\n\nOwen\n\n\n\n'
'\n\nPoliticians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool \nfor fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole \n\'anonymity\' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the \nCanadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just \na branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about \nCanada featured the head of its military, \'speaking to us from military \nHQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.\'\nOwen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.\n*Will Canada\'s ISPs become spies?*\nBy Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>\nStaff Writer, CNET News.com\nAugust 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT\nhttp://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html \n<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>\n\n*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that \nwould force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy \nsurveillance by police and spy agencies.*\n\nA discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> \nreleased Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every \nCanadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the \nright to be anonymous online.\n\nThe Canadian government, including the Department of Justice \n<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada \n<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step \nin a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to \nconduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion \ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \nearly 2003.\n\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \nCouncil of Europe\'s cybercrime treaty \n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \nprocess of considering.\n\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden \nelectronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In \nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\n\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \nEurope, and representatives from both countries\' police agencies have \nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \nor ratified, the treaty.\n\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \nweak.\n\n"It seems to me that the main justification they\'ve given for all the \nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \nmake changes," Geist said. "To me that\'s not a particularly convincing \nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \nmake that case."\n\nGeist added that "there\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \npowers) are needed. I don\'t know that there have been a significant \nnumber of cases where police have run into problems."\n\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\n\n"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be \nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\n\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their \nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \njust Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals \nonly with computer data."

The American public couldn\'t care\nless.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a\nthreat, and it isn\'t the third-world.  Many European and other developed\nnations aggressively engage in covert operations against American\ninterests.  Its been going on for years and isn\'t even news.

The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,\nobviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do\ndirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with\ngovernment "advisors" along for the mission).  I\'ve always wondered what\nthe deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that\nwe\'ve acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders\nagainst their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and\nin recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the\nmilitary specifically because of the circumstances of some of these\nmissions while they were posted for that duty. I\'m certainly glad I was\nnever assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of\ncovert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.\n\nRegardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created\nmeaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion\nunder any other guise.\n\n \n> A lot of the current EU - US issues can be explained by this difference \n> of perception, such as the current American unilateralism (nobody wants \n> to help us!), the American arrogance towards Europe (they don\'t want to \n> do anything, so why should we ask them?) and the growing rejection of the \n> American policy in Europe (they want to abolish the law!).\n\n\nEurope is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems\nthe US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill\nfaster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the\nEuropean way of doing things is beyond me.\n\nThe US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack\nfor medical advice.  I really don\'t see what is wrong with "unilateral"\nanyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?\nI hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see\ncoming from Europe doesn\'t actually represent the views of Europeans. \n\nFor various reasons I\'m not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,\nbut the premises of the argument against them here are lame.\n\n\n> My personal point is that few Americans (percentage of overall population)\n> have ever left their country, while even German construction workers\n> regularly spend their holidays in Spain. So I\'m not surprised that\n> paranoia is growing.\n\n\nI\'m betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast\nmajority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the\ncountry at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled\nanywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. \nDespite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of\nthe universe.  I\'ll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider\nEurope to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But\nfrom the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this\nway?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the\nyears.\n\nI love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.\n\nFirst, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and\nculturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout\nNorth America knows this isn\'t true; there are more than five major and\nvery distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the\nhundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly\nforeign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with\nhaving the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally\nidentical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A\nWyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with\nyour average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same\nlanguage and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a\nwildly different culture for the holidays, I\'ll go to Oakland, New\nOrleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live\nthan some countries I\'ve traveled to.  And a lot of these places are\nfarther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.\n\nSecond, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a\nneighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? \nIn fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your\nGerman construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,\nonly then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous\nsuperiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?\n\nIn truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the\nUS.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with\nrelatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very\nsimilar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have\ndozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an\nadvantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can\'t\nunderstand a word they are saying either. \n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\n\n\n'
'\n\nI got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his\nreign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real\nhands off approach, so it\'s funny that they would blame\nthe regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did\nget right, is that he wasn\'t worried that the US was behind\nEurope in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something\nvery prescient in that most of those licensors have had to\neat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for\nvery little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be\nrethinking the FCC\'s role to stay out of the way in this\nperiod of business innovation in the wireless space as he\ndidn\'t want the government forcing business models onto\nthe private sector.\n\nHis full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I\ngot to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole\nCTIA\'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and\nI hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support\nfor Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there\'s no difference\nbetween wired and wireless Internet--it\'s all the same thing.\nInstead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable\ncontent (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial\nfrom a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with\nthe content scaling back for each target platform).\n\nThe best part of the whole trip wasn\'t hobnobbing at all,\nbut really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.\nThey decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high\nroller rooms.

Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \n> wasn\'t as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \n> movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \n> Furchtgott-Roth.\n> \n> Powell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \n> before a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \n> gave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \n> free-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore\'s Law)—that \n> began by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \n> telecom companies alive. "In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \n> often cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas," Powell said. "Like the \n> Whos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \n> beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \n> deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act\'s \n> fertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \n> least, so it is thought." Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \n> chairman he didn\'t expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \n> part of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \n> of the Bush Administration.\n> \n> Twenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \n> or dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \n> serious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \n> companies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \n> concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \n> companies\' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \n> good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \n> companies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \n> financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \n> industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \n> wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \n> if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \n> duopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \n> And these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \n> poor health of the long-distance companies.\n> \n> The cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \n> companies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \n> don\'t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \n> fully control what material they allow to enter people\'s homes. As part \n> of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \n> Telecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \n> significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \n> radio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \n> per cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \n> programming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \n> of Viacom.\n> \n> In this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \n> be hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \n> rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \n> to breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \n> disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \n> forces of concentration. It should use the government\'s money and muscle \n> to get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \n> homes of people who can\'t afford it at current market prices. (An \n> analogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \n> the Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \n> people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \n> people blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \n> expectations and stirred too many passions.)\n> \n> But Michael Powell\'s F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \n> conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \n> F.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \n> signals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \n> the F.C.C.\'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn\'t mean he has \n> been inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \n> infuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \n> the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \n> F.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he\'s \n> having the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \n> when he was asked what he was going to do about the "digital \n> divide"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \n> "You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I\'d like to have one and \n> I can\'t afford one." At the National Cable & Telecommunications \n> Association convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \n> tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \n> somersault.\n> \n> \n> Not long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \n> 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \n> Washington, near the city\'s open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \n> the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \n> else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \n> looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \n> Even the chairman\'s suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \n> fluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \n> walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \n> jeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \n> of the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \n> became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \n> the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \n> the market before the fact—"prophylactically," as he likes to say—should \n> wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \n> litigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \n> then became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \n> of the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government\'s \n> legal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \n> the New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell\'s political \n> skill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \n> Administration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \n> also maintains close ties to Bush\'s nemesis Senator John McCain, of \n> Arizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \n> enduring love of law school—"It\'s sort of like a law-school study \n> session over there," one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \n> confirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \n> students, summer interns at the commission, whom he\'d invited to sit in.\n> \n> I began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \n> of the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \n> airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\n> \n> "I think we\'ll never know," Powell said. "I don\'t think it\'s an \n> automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \n> the best analogue. We don\'t seize all the land in the United States and \n> say, \'The government will issue licenses to use land.\' If my neighbor \n> puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there\'s a whole body of law \n> about what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \n> a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it\'s a \n> similar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \n> Ronald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \n> spectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \n> of ways that we\'re accustomed to."\n> \n> Talking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \n> doesn\'t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \n> slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \n> ironic air quotes. He\'s like your libertarian friend in college who \n> enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \n> about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \n> sees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \n> thought his predecessors\' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \n> Act had been excessive.\n> \n> "I would start with a caveat," Powell said. "Look, I can\'t fault those \n> judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \n> They were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \n> But, frankly, I\'ve always been a little bit critical. First of all, \n> anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn\'t come anywhere close \n> to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \n> on down, about the kinds of things it\'s going to open up. I mean, I \n> don\'t know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \n> or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \n> were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \n> reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \n> But, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \n> excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \n> certainly was.\n> \n> "But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \n> expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \n> economy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \n> exaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by \n> politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \n> gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \n> that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \n> see numbers go up on the board."\n> \n> Powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. " \n> \'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \n> thirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \n> Bells to bleed! Then we\'ll know we\'ve succeeded.\' " Now Powell returned \n> to being Powell. "I think that expectation was astonishingly \n> unrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they\'re \n> there. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \n> the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There\'s no \n> question, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \n> debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model."\n> \n> How could the Telecom Act have been handled better? "We could have \n> chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \n> slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system," \n> Powell said. "Money chased what seemed like government-promised \n> opportunity. The problem with that is there\'s a morning after, and we\'re \n> in it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \n> debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \n> ways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability."\n> \n> Powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \n> had been a more "reasonable" level of investment. "No, we wouldn\'t have \n> every home in America with competitive choice yet—but we don\'t anyway. I \n> don\'t think it\'s the remonopolization of telephone service. I don\'t buy \n> that. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn\'t? The \n> part of the story that didn\'t materialize was that people thought so \n> would MCI WorldCom and Sprint."\n> \n> Other local phone companies, he added, hadn\'t materialized as viable \n> businesses, either, and they never might. "Everybody\'s always saying, \n> \'The regulators did this and this and this.\' But, candidly, the story\'s \n> quite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \n> years to give them a chance. Conditions don\'t get that good except once \n> every thirty years, and it didn\'t happen. So, whatever the reason, we\'re \n> looking at a WorldCom that\'s teetering. We\'re looking at a long-distance \n> business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \n> breaking itself up. Sprint has struggled."\n> \n> Could the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \n> stronger? "At the F.C.C.? I think I\'ll just be blunt. My political \n> answer? Yes, there\'s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \n> to help. But I can\'t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \n> I can\'t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \n> investigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don\'t have \n> those kinds of levers. I don\'t know whether anybody does. At some point, \n> companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \n> dying." Powell couldn\'t have made it much clearer that he doesn\'t think \n> it\'s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \n> demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \n> gestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \n> F.C.C.\'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \n> appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \n> communications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \n> out the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \n> and Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \n> up the telecom industry.\n> \n> I asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \n> company provided cable television and only one provided local phone \n> service. "Yes," he said. "It concerns us that there\'s one of each of \n> those things, but let\'s not diminish the importance of there being one \n> of each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \n> capabilities, even if they aren\'t direct analogues of each other." \n> Anyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \n> provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \n> provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \n> "So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \n> is, Does it stay that way?"\n> \n> The concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \n> information did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \n> people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \n> which distorts markets. "If this were just economics, it\'s easy. If you \n> were to say to me, \'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,\' we \n> know how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \n> market\'s too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \n> other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \n> the question of, if everybody\'s controlling what you see, the assumption \n> there is that somehow there\'ll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \n> viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won\'t get diversity. I \n> think that\'s a possibility. I don\'t think it\'s nearly the possibility \n> that\'s ascribed to it sometimes."\n> \n> Powell explained, "Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \n> parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \n> same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \n> exists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \n> the planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \n> and then we have policies like"—here his tone went from ironic to \n> sarcastic—"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \n> of what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \n> and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \n> fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."\n> \n> \n> F.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \n> can\'t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \n> he regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \n> market, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he\'s carrying \n> water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \n> planning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \n> Attorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn\'t want to do anything \n> at the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he\'s \n> waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \n> so that he doesn\'t wind up going first and getting caught in the \n> crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \n> networks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \n> Telecom, after Colin Powell\'s idea that the United States should never \n> commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \n> and an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \n> says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \n> irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\n> \n> "This is why elections matter," Reed Hundt, who isn\'t happy about what \n> has become of his Telecom Act, told me. It\'s true that the F.C.C.—much \n> more than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore \n> Administration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \n> Administration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \n> there\'s no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \n> arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \n> have done if Gore had won. Next election, they\'ll help the party that \n> helped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \n> arbocks\' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks\' rivals—the \n> long-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts—with their \n> friends now in power, will stage a comeback.

'\n\nI have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now.   (It is\namazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for\nUPS\'s to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and\nits battery supply...)\n\nFirst, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was\noccurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a\nsequence that isn\'t either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of\nsuch things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.\nThis one solves the initial problem:\n\n--- mh.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:06 2002\n+++ mh.tcl\tWed Aug 28 12:39:11 2002\n@@ -487,6 +487,10 @@\n     set seq {}\n     set rseq {}\n     foreach range [split [string trim $sequence]] {\n+\tif ![regexp {^[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?$} $range] {\n+\t    # just ignore anything bogus\n+\t    continue;\n+\t}\n \tset parts [split [string trim $range] -]\n \tif {[llength $parts] == 1} {\n \t    lappend seq $parts\n\n\nThat is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring\nbefore (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should\nprobably make sure that\'s true - issue an error instead of just "continue"\nif you like, but I don\'t think an error is needed).\n\nBut that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,\nby typing "NNN-" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,\nI thought I should think more about Brent\'s suggestion.   But rather than\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\na "catch" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\nuser has typed.\n\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\nallowing a sequence name, like "prev" or "next", or anything else can\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\n\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\nIf you type "66+" the "66" changes to "67" (and so on, for each + that\nis typed).   I suspect that\'s perhaps an artifact of "+ is bound to a\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...", but now I found it,\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\n\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \'+\' - the special\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\'s no way to type those from\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\nrestrictions - there\'s no way to type a folder name that has a name\nbeginning with \'+\' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\ntoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name\nbeing typed is empty.   I\'m less happy about that part, but I think I\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\'s in them to\nexist and be typed.\n\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In "normal" keyboard mode, \'s\' is\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\'ve just typed 123, and\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\nshow that message, you can\'t type \'s\', you have to type \\r instead.\nSo I "fixed" this one as well.   "Fixed" here is in quotes, as it assumes\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \'s\', if you change that to something\nelse, it will remain \'s\' in here.   I don\'t know enough tk/tcl to have it\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\nto bind the same one here.   \\r continues to work of course.\n\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\nreverted to its usual bindings.\n\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\n"catch" around the "MsgShow" will hide the problem (I don\'t think we really\nneed to fix Brent\'s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\nfor completeness (I haven\'t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\nthe previous one, so I don\'t know for sure that all will be OK then).\n\nkre\n\n--- select.tcl.WAS\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\n+++ select.tcl\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\n     bind $w <Any-Key>\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\n     bind $w <Key-plus>\t{SelectToggle %W }\n+    bind $w <Key-minus>\t{SelectPrev %W }\n     bind $w <space>\t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w <Tab>\t{SelectComplete %W}\n     bind $w <Return>\t{SelectReturn %W}\n+    bind $w <Key-s>\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\n     bind $w <BackSpace>\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w <Control-h>\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n     bind $w <Delete>\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\n     append select(sel) $a\n     Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\n-\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\n     }\n }\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$select(sel) != ""} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w +\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\n \tset select(prompt) "[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:"\n     } else {\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\n     }\n     Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"\n }\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\n+    global select\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tSelectTypein $w "-"\n+    } else {\n+\tcatch {\n+\t    incr select(sel) -1\n+\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\n+\t}\n+        Exmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"\n+    }\n+}\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\n \tExmh_Status "$select(prompt) $select(sel)"\n     }\n }\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\n     global select\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\n+\tif {$a != {}} {\n+\t    SelectTypein $w $a\n+\t    return\n+\t}\n \tif [info exists select(match)] {\n \t    set select(sel) $select(match)\n \t    unset select(match)\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\n \tunset select(folder)\n     }\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\n+    Exmh_Status ""\n     Exmh_Focus\n }\n proc SelectClear { w } {\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n'

Look for the \n"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename" output in the debug log to see when sequences \nare actually reread from disk.\n\n\nMy theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.

Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have\nchanged.\n\nAlso, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of \none sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.  \nIn a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.\n\nIf nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.\n\nChris\n\n-- \nChris Garrigues                 http://www.DeepEddy.Com/~cwg/\nvirCIO                          http://www.virCIO.Com\n716 Congress, Suite 200\nAustin, TX  78701\t\t+1 512 374 0500\n\n  World War III:  The Wrong-Doers Vs. the Evil-Doers.\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_927886807P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.2_20000822 06/23/2000\n\niD8DBQE9bPUlK9b4h5R0IUIRAqCdAJkBYATj6wLY6RM/EPECD3yGkXMXVgCcDADM\n4n+q/8HdvWmkRlGJn3lUb1M=\n=Rd2E\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_927886807P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-workers mailing list\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\n\n"

'\n\nWell, I\'ve used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in\nmany places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it\nis effective.

Just idle speculation - we can\nstick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.\n\nSomeone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.\nWe could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -\nTcl has had "clock seconds" (like gettimeofday) and "clock clicks"\n(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we\'ve calibrated\nclock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for\nrelative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond\ndelta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all\nthe overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I\'ll try it out.\n\n>>>Chris Garrigues said:\n > > From:  Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>\n > > Date:  Wed, 28 Aug 2002 10:32:42 -0700\n > >\n > > \n > > >>>Robert Elz said:\n > >  > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\n > >  > context file) but I\'m not sure how frequently that one is called.\n > > \n > > In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify\n > time,\n > > but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to\n > > check their date stamp, you could just read them again.\n > \n > Do you really think this is true?

'\n\n2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -\nbyte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in\nits parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where\nTcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a "pattern - body"\nstrucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find\na pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.

(Is that permitted? :)\n\nI started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.\n\nWhat I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.\n\nI haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.\n\n-=d\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n"

I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,\nsometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus\nthere, so no passphrase can be entered.

'\n\nI\'ve never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here\'s the \nbehaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I \nalso have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh \nwindow and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select \nit and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the \nrecently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and \nleave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no \nlonger highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this \nbehaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what \nI paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more \nspecific, here\'s what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:\n\nApplication       What gets pasted\n\nXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh\nxterm             same as XEmacs\nAbiWord           nothing\nNedit             nothing\nsedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten\n\nThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then \nobviously that\'s what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets \npasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted \nand typed over (I have "Type Kills SEL" on.).\n\nIt seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to \npaste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??\n\n--\nrick\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

(And it it\nlikely that an application that wrote an internal "copy" command would\nalso have their own customized "paste" command, to make sure the two\nwork together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste\nfunctions interoperate with the X server\'s global select and paste\nfunctions will vary from program to program, because in each case you\nare relying on the program\'s authors\' efforts to blend separate systems.\n\n\n Jacob Morzinski                                jmorzins@mit.edu\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

'\n\nI guess the first question here should be does anyone have some\nupdates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?\n\nMy current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first\nget a button that reads:\n\t"Check the signature with GnuPG"\nIf I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring\nthen I get a message saying just that, and the message:\n\t"Can\'t check signature: public key not found"\nalong with a button with the inscription\n\t"Query keyserver"\nIf I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.\n\nIf instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself\nand then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it\nmust be the code that goes out to the keyserver.\n\nAnyone else with this problem?\nThis is EXMH v2.5 and tcl/tk 8.4a4\n-- \n                                        Reg.Clemens\n                                        reg@dwf.com\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

Like if\nyou absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources\nwith different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump\nrelease numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert\ninto apt and let loose... :)\n\nDoesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as\nup2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another\nrepository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC.

Windows and Macintosh\nhave a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I\'m quite\nsure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.\nThe PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection\non your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit\nCopy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.\nHowever, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is\nanother archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)\nby versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these\nmechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.\n\nI would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in\nText_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up\nwith 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another\nsetting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,\nthat\'s an admission of policy failure, but I\'m willing to do that.\n\n--\nBrent Welch\nSoftware Architect, Panasas Inc\nPioneering the World\'s Most Scalable and Agile Storage Network\nwww.panasas.com\nwelch@panasas.com\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

Of course,\n  | that\'s an admission of policy failure, but I\'m willing to do that.\n\nI actually think you\'re looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,\nhave almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or\nselected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,\nwhich appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.\n\nThe problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)\nwhere it shouldn\'t - the previous selection should only be cleared\nwhen there\'s something else to replace it (even if the highlighting\nof what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom\napplication (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There\nnormally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary\nselection (that is, set it to be a null string).\n\nThen, because of the "if I get asked for the selection value, I will\nfind something" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert\npoint, the way most other GUI\'s operate), and then paste, because the\nPRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing\nelse has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from\neither the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was\ndeleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.\n\nThat behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.\n\nOnce that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal\n"select stuff, click at new insert point, paste" mode of operation\nthat almost everyone expects to work (whether the "select stuff"\nis somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).\n\nkre\n\nps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I\'ve never\nreally understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that\npart of the code and see how it all really operates.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

And in what version?\n(I\'m running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)\n\n\tI went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.\nGoing back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew\nit MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my \n~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the\nsettings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded\nstate, etc. \n\tI have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at\n1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)\n\tSearching for \'unseen\' in that file found this section:\n\nNEW: exmh.Exmh\nNAME: exmh\nCLASS: Exmh\nNEW: unseen.UnseenWin\nNAME: unseen\nCLASS: UnseenWin\nDESKTOP: 0\nRES: 1600 1200\nWH: 114 173\nXY: 1655 150 0 0\nLAYER: 4\nSTICKY: 1\nSKIPTASK: 0\nSKIPWINLIST: 0\nSKIPFOCUS: 0\nSHADE: 2\nBORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE\n\n\tI changed:\nXY: 1655 150 0 0  \tto \nXY: 1455 150 0 0\tso it would reappear in my viewable space,\nrestarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!\nThere was my window! \n\n\tI quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that\nwindow except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:\n\nNEW: exmh.Exmh\nNAME: exmh\nCLASS: Exmh\nNEW: unseen.UnseenWin\nNAME: unseen\nCLASS: UnseenWin\nBORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE\n\n\tCompletely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how\nit got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can\'t move a window off\nscreen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when\nshading.)\n\n\tHmm.

That program is called \nthe local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)\n\nIt would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a \n"mailbox" file.\n\nIf your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the \nreceiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail \nas the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and \ndeliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.\n\nMost Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a\n$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.\n\n\n--Hal\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

The "From " \nenvelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that \nperspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in\nmbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with \n"From ". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail \ntransport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body \nalone.\nThings like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message \nbody.\n\nAlso, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, \nthe UUCP envelope) isn\'t just any line beginning with "From ". It\'s really \n"From", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid \ndate.\nFor example:\n\n    From ptardif@nbnet.nb.ca  Sun Jul 14 08:53:57 2002\n        ^                   ^^\n\n\n-- \nJohn Abreau / Executive Director, Boston Linux & Unix \nIM: jabr@jabber.blu.org / abreauj@aim / abreauj@yahoo / 28611923@icq\nEmail jabr@blu.org / WWW http://www.abreau.net / PGP-Key-ID 0xD5C7B5D9\nPGP-Key-Fingerprint 72 FB 39 4F 3C 3B D6 5B E0 C8 5A 6E F1 2C BE 99\n\n   Some people say, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."\n   I often respond, "When elephants fight, it\'s the grass\n   that gets trampled."\n\n\n\n\n--==_Exmh_1405404058P\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.6 (GNU/Linux)\nComment: Exmh version 2.5 01/15/2001\n\niQCVAwUBPaScZlV9A5rVx7XZAQJlrgQAyxnhXLaYoas75wtCkQz7pr5jhTamXm9s\n85Tx9R9YcZtAAK67wd7U6ZqIOcr+J76G/xn2+gm6ASVRL4/ipETx9AFhdq8pG//w\nsU/8zYCxOrnmqVI62sYaqx2m4m75IrnSdqR5ARKHc2U05zQq47xuMxSTIrC/dwKK\noyAlEFSe8Rw=\n=mVfx\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--==_Exmh_1405404058P--\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nExmh-users mailing list\nExmh-users@redhat.com\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\n\n\n'

But it doesn't complain about linker \nproblems.

The only little\n(unimportant) catch is to replace "kernel-headers" by "glibc-kernheaders",\na simple "apt-get install glibc-kernheaders" taking care of that.\n\nUpgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and\nreleases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,\nsome others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different\ndependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through\napt/rhn/whatever just won\'t do, as some older packages might be considered\nas the newest, thus being kept on the system.\n\nAs Red Hat does, I really don\'t recommend trying to upgrade between betas\nor from a beta to a final release either.

You did put \n/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use \nthe same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the \ndata as is.\n\nIf you didn\'t put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need \nto make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup \nand rsync straight to the mount, or if that\'s not possible, rsync over \nssh.

'\n\n\n    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of \'sheep\' can look at and say "Cool; I can understand this" and leave their shackles behind.  :)\n\n    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It\'s obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more \'international\'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a \'world\' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.\n\n    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.\n\n    At some point I\'d miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I\'ll probably \'hotrod\' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one\'s IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you\'ll be surprisingly pleased.\n  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrian Fahrländer              Linux Zealot, Conservative, and Technomad\nEvansville, IN                    My Voyage: http://www.CounterMoon.com\nICQ  5119262\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJust machines, to make big decisions- programmed by fellas with\ncompassion and vision.

It\'s possible\nMatthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st\ninstall, that was a long time ago for me.\n\nThose ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but\nit\'s been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.\n\n--\nThat\'s "angle" as in geometry.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n\n'

Then RH will\napply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice that\ndifferent GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.\n\nThis "gtk2-engines-compat" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that are\nincluded in the RH package "gtk-engines" themes pack for GTK1.\n\nThe "gtk1+2-themez" pack mostly repackages my previous theme RPMs in a way that the\n(null) btea like, and supposedly the next RH8 when released :)\n\nforward - original mail:\n  From " Angles  Puglisi" <angles@aminvestments.com>\n  Date 09/01/2002 - 06:10:03 am\n  Subject some (null) eyecandy packages\n\n-----=_Next_Part_10878775_zmiO_mWTr_109818780\nContent-Type: message/rfc822;\nContent-Disposition: inline\n\nDelivered-To: limbo-list@listman.example.com\nX-Originating-IP: [207.172.11.147]\nFrom: "" Angles " Puglisi" <angles@aminvestments.com>\nTo: limbo-list@example.com\nSubject: some (null) eyecandy packages\nMessage-ID: <20020901.eak.70699000@www.dudex.net>\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n\tcharset="iso-8859-1"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\nContent-Disposition: inline\nX-Mailer: AngleMail for phpGroupWare (http://www.phpgroupware.org) v 0.9.14.000\nX-Loop: limbo-list@example.com\nSender: limbo-list-admin@example.com\nErrors-To: limbo-list-admin@example.com\nX-BeenThere: limbo-list@example.com\nX-Mailman-Version: 2.0.1\nPrecedence: bulk\nReply-To: limbo-list@example.com\nList-Help: <mailto:limbo-list-request@example.com?subject=help>\nList-Post: <mailto:limbo-list@example.com>\nList-Subscribe: <https://listman.example.com/mailman/listinfo/limbo-list>,\n\t<mailto:limbo-list-request@redhat.com?subject=subscribe>\nList-Id: Discussion of the Red Hat Linux \'Limbo\' beta <limbo-list.example.com>\nList-Unsubscribe: <https://listman.example.com/mailman/listinfo/limbo-list>,\n\t<mailto:limbo-list-request@redhat.com?subject=unsubscribe>\nList-Archive: <https://listman.example.com/pipermail/limbo-list/>\nDate: Sun, 01 Sep 2002 10:01:54 +0000\n\nI make these for myself, you may find them of interest.

'\n\nHi all,\n\nI\'ve decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is\nthat I\'ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually\ntesting the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality\npeople seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from\nthat, right? ;-)\n\nI\'ve got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages\nshould easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and\nmaybe others, who knows ;-)\n\nHere are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :\n- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel\n  (you can install the binary package if you\'re using the i686 2.4.18-10)\n- Install this "alsa-driver" package\n- Install the "alsa-libs" package\n- Install the "alsa-utils" package\n\nNow go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your\n/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/\n(very complete and very good documentation!)\nHopefully you\'ll see that your card *is* supported ;-)\n\nReboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you\'ll probably need\nto stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and\ninsert the new ones. If all is well you\'ve got ALSA working! ("dmesg" to\ncheck is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with\ne.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.\n\nWith "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You\ncan also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...\nhmmm, but maybe it\'s another plugin) to listen to your good ol\' mp3\nfiles... that\'s it!\n\nIt really isn\'t complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only\nthing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can\'t\nimagine myself doing that ;-) I\'ve repackaged everything cleanly. Even the\n/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly\n%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d\nstructure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the\ndefault provided ALSA spec files, for example I\'ve split alsa-lib\'s\ndevelopment files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static\nlibraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against\nwhich the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the\nrpm release, so does the architecture!).\n\nI\'m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!\n\nDownload :\nhttp://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/\n\nCurrent spec files :\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec\nhttp://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec\n(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )\n\nMatthias\n\nPS: As an extra bonus, I\'ve also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply\nrun "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)\n\n-- \nClean custom Red Hat Linux rpm packages : http://freshrpms.net/\nRed Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla) running Linux kernel 2.4.18-10\nLoad : 0.57 0.42 0.42, AC on-line, battery charging: 29% (1:55)\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n'

'\n\nBlogStart: \n\n**Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from\nThe Irish Digest about \'\'Billy in the Bowl\'\'.  This story is also immortalised\nin an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy\nwas a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I\nnow live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely\nlegal, way to make money.\n\nBlogEnd: \nLinkText: Billy in the Bowl\n\nFrom:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>\nSubject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nA story of my new neighbourhood...\n\n\nThe Irish Digest July 1964\n\n\nThe Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler\n\nThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.\nThen, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life \n\nDUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the\narchitectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of\nbeggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these\nbeggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one\nwho campaigned among the working class.  This was "Billy In The Bowl"\n\nThe strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy\'s sole means\nof transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this "\nbowl ", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\n\nBilly\'s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\nunusually handsome face.\n\nThis was Billy\'s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\n\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\ncome along.\n\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\n\n"Billy in the Bowl", however, wasn\'t satisfied with becoming the daily\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\n\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\nDublin\'s North Quays.\n\nWhen Billy heard the woman\'s footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\n\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\n\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his " bowl ", his victirn\'s\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\nassailant.  And, as "Billy in the Bowl" had figured, nobody would suspect a\ndeformed beggar.\n\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\n\nOn one occasion " Billy in "the Bowl " tried his tactics on a sturdy\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\nand caused a great stir.\n\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\n"Billy in the Bowl" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\nperiod, Dublin\'s first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\n\nMonths passed and  "Billy in the Bowl" reverted once again to his old\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\nalong in his "bowl" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\nfinished Billy\'s career of crime.\n\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\nditch.\n\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\nhowever) and while resisting tore \'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\n\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\n\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\n\n"Billy in the Bowl" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\n\n\n\ndaev\n\n_______________________________\nRev.

'\n\n> I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To\n> me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone\'s defenses against spam.\n\nYou\'re not dense. I\'m going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of\nSpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it\'s\nsimple:\n\n1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use\nHabeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only\nbulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I\nalready whitelist them. Individuals won\'t bother.\n\n2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good\npercentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.\n\nI think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other\npotential new rule. When I test against my corpus here\'s what I get:\n\nOVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME\n  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)\n      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWE\n\nThe score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a\nuseless rule so far.\n\n--\nMichael Moncur  mgm at starlingtech.com  http://www.starlingtech.com/\n"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake." --Napoleon\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\'s fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!

Habeas runs something called the \n"Habeas Infringers List", and if you use their trademark without \ntheir permission, you\'ll end up on it.

You might track down\nwhoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be\nmore difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer\nthey haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,\nnot to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with\nthe whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be\nheld liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world's fastest growing \nreal-time communications platform!

The spam \noften appears to originate there because it\'s coming from open \nhttp, or squid proxy servers.  It\'s hosted there because these \nspammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.

Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to \nthe news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to \nhim, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime \ncandidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. \nThomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard \nhe\'d been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his \nbusiness partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You\'ve \nheard of PopLaunch, right?)\n\n>  - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!

There \nwere some "interesting" conversations. This summer, the SEC \nreleased the following:\n\nhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm\n\nYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty \nfor operating a pump-and-dump scam isn\'t small.

'\n\nGuys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with\nspammers while we\'re getting judgments against them and especially in\nother countries, where those judgments are harder to get.\n\nPlease note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after\nregular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant\npyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the\nvast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I\ncan\'t understand how Daniel can assert that you can\'t track spammers\ndown when it\'s never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of\nthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for\nthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,\nthese people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they\'re not\nsecret agents.  They\'re just trying to make a buck, and Habeas\' whole\nbusiness is about finding them and putting them out of business\n\nHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)\nin a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business\nplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with "not spam", I can\'t\nunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be\nunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the\npotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the\nHabeas warrant mark.\n\nDaniel, it\'s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on\nyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only\nlicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on\nthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove\nus from the next release.  But, you\'re trying to kill Habeas before it\nhas a chance to show any promise.\n\nAt the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it\nencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those\nwithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the\ntransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don\'t\nsteal any more cars.  But only if we\'re given a chance to succeed.\n\n          - dan\n--\nDan Kohn <mailto:dan@dankohn.com>\n<http://www.dankohn.com/>  <tel:+1-650-327-2600> \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] \nSent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38\nTo: Matthew Cline\nCc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net\nSubject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

Then score it based on actual results, not\npromises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message\nwith a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn\'t impress me and it wouldn\'t\nimpress the GA either.

There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the \nHTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to \nrelease), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40.

It\nshould have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores\nwere included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely\nsymmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been\nbalancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.\nThen anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative\nwould be non-spam.

Anyone have hints on this issue ?\n\nWhat do you mean by "CD-Key or the like" (I presume that "of" was a\ntypo)? And what do you mean by "unbreakable"?\n\nYou need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to\nsolve, and about the constraints involved.\n\nSome general points:\n\n1. For a conventional "CD key" system, where the actual CDs are\nmass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire\nsystem has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys\nbeing "traded" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the\nproduct).\n\nIf there\'s an online element involved, you can "tie" keys to a\nspecific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP\'s\n"product activation".\n\n2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be\nvulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within\nthe executable.\n\n3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to\n"cracking", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the\nvalidation checks.\n\nThis can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a\nPalladium-style system).\n\nMost significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only\naccessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a\nmeaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts\nand discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).\n\nIOW, you have to "keep the genie in the bottle" at all times. If the\ndata can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated\nhardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and\ndistributed without limit.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>\n\n'

But, in all probability: no, it isn\'t usually worth it. So, it\ncomes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker\'s job.\n\nIf the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying\nwon\'t work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is\nwhether you\'re actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,\nor just make sure that it isn\'t trivial.\n\nA lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be\nmore concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,\nand so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely\nto view matters differently.\n\n> Does it really make it more secure ?\n\nYes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same\nis ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to\nrequire resources other than just labour.\n\nAlmost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible\nto ensure that doing so is uneconomical.\n\n> Look at the DVDs.\n\nIIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and\none where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.\n\n-- \nGlynn Clements <glynn.clements@virgin.net>\n\n'

They have \nan internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted \nhardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a \nmonthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of "renting" the \nsystem.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to \ndecrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled \nand the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.\n\nThis sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong \nabout the safety of a smart card.  \n\nWhat do you think ?\n\n-- \nYannick Gingras\nCoder for OBB : Oceangoing Bared Bonanza\nhttp://OpenBeatBox.org\n\n\n'

'\n\n\nI\'ve got a test set here that\'s the last 3 and a bit years email to\ninfo@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it\'s a really ugly set of 20,000+\nmessages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently\nunclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different \nekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.\n\nAs well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about \ncredit card charges, it has people interested in the service and \nasking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots \nof "commercial" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty \nbadly wrong.\n\nI\'m currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever \nelse :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers \n(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of \n(header,count_of_header).

'\n\nThis is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general\ndealing-with-SPAM issue.\n\nWhat is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?\nThere are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the \'MAIL\nFROM\' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think\nmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a "permanent" error. That\npretty much means, "Don\'t bother to try from that address again,\nyou\'ll get the same error." People often add cathartic messages to\naccompany the 550 like, "Spammers must die."\n\nBut this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers\nthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to\nget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?\nThat is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but\nthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how\nSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP\ntransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is\ngoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.\n\nThen there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code\nindicating you\'re on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is\nsaying "mailbox does not exist." This would be in the hopes that some\nspammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from\ntheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can\nlower the incidence.\n\nSo, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of\nthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be\nhuge. Personally, I\'m starting to think blackholes are the way to\ngo... But sending back that "Spammer die, die, die," or stock "Access\nDEE-NIED!" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)\n-- \nCrist J.

The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never\never existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to\ndeliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering\nto 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting "User unknown" until I\ngot around to making them spamtraps.\n\nSo my evidence would suggest that it depends who you\'re dealing with. :)\nIf your "business" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,\nit\'s in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can\nsay "10 million email addresses" and not technically be lying, even if\nthe majority of them don\'t work.\n\nIf you\'re a spammer, you\'d want to know who doesn\'t actually exist, but\nthen again you don\'t really care: you probably want to relay through\nsomeone so it\'s harder to trace you, if you could you\'d send to every\nemail address available, you don\'t want to setup a valid bounce address\nbecause again it\'s easy to trace you.\n\nSo I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think\nyou\'re running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of\nopting out (even though the user didn\'t opt in) and you probably don\'t\nrelay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.\n\nEveryone else doesn\'t really care.\n\n\nThat\'s my view anyway. :)\n\n--=20\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n"Now you can do that thing with your hands...

It\'s a semi-usual spammer trick\nactually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary\nsince it will either have less filtering, or be "trusted", or ...\n\nMX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5:\n\n[...]\n   Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used\n   in sorting (see below).  Lower numbers are more preferred than higher\n   ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference\n   and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an\n   easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to\n   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific\n   organization.\n[...]\n   If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting\n   the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for\n   delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the\n   lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST\n   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it\n   might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,\n   all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be\n   discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that\n   point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as\n   undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best\n   preference first, as described above.\n\n--=20\nRandomly Generated Tagline:\n"Now let\'s say I like sheep...

My spamtraps are\n> pretty clean of viruses and bounce messages most of the time.\n\nIMO spamtrap data that\'s well-cleaned and monitored is fine.\n\nTo my mind there\'s 3 types of spamtraps:\n\n  1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes\n    the account\n\n  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the\n    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed\n    from them etc.\n\n  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.\n\nThe latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots\nof maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data\nhad a few 1\'s contributed by ISPs, and I hadn\'t spent enough time sifting\nfor legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving\nthem out for this run, apart from what I\'d hand-cleaned.\n\n--j.\n\n'

From past results,\nwhat\'s needed are one or more of the below:\n        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,\n           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow\n           for having "correlated" mutations - in other words, have a\n           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at\n           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly\n           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the\n           "Evolutionary Strategies" of Schwefel;\n        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how\n           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a\n           fifth of the new "individuals" are doing about as well as, or\n           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more\n           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well\n           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less\n           parameters.\n\n        -Allen\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n\n'

'\n\nThis is just an semi-educated guess - if I\'m wrong, someone please correct\nme!\n\nSpamd setuid\'s to the user running spamc. Since you\'re calling spamc from a\nglobal procmailrc file, it\'s being run as root (most likely). If called as\nroot, spamd won\'t open user_prefs files.\n\n>>From the spamc man page:\n\n       -u username\n           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use\n           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config\n           files spamd should load.  If you\'re running spamc as some\n           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)\n           then you can still use this flag.\n\n\nThe solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running\nspamc. From the procmailrc man page:\n\n       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes\' procmail will drop all privileges\n                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only\n                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom\n                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on\n                   behalf of the recipient.\n\n\nI hope that helps, and I also hope it\'s right!\n\nSt-\n\n\n| -----Original Message-----\n| From: spamassassin-talk-admin@example.sourceforge.net\n| [mailto:spamassassin-talk-admin@lists.sourceforge.net]On Behalf Of\n| Cheryl L.

Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don\'t want\nto see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different\nperl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.\n\n2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they\'re in\nthe perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not\nknow about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5\nfor storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So\nwe need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that\'s\nthe problem!\n\n3. try "perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null" to allow bots to build it.\n\nI think I might be missing some details of what you\'re peeved about,\nthough... could you elaborate specifically?\n\n\n\n\n------- You are receiving this mail because: -------\nYou are the assignee for the bug, or are watching the assignee.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-devel mailing list\nSpamassassin-devel@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-devel\n\n\n'
'\n\nhttp://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1046\n\n\n\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From spamassassin-contrib@msquadrat.de  2002-10-03 13:57 -------\n> I\'ve thought about this and PM_FILTER needs to die. I\'ve now tried  \n> multiple ways to make it just transparently work on 5.00503 and failed.  \n> If anyone has any bright ideas please jump in. \n>  \n> You see anyone upgrading from the CPAN shell will get a failure on the line: \n>  \n>    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45; \n \nQuite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or \nread so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: \n"ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \nMakefile.PL line 2." \n \n> Because it never gets chance to reach a "WriteMakefile" line with a  \n> PREREQ_PM => { ExtUtils::MakeMaker => 5.45 } option. So the CPAN shell  \n> can\'t automatically upgrade this module. I cannot think of any way  \n> around this. \n \nI could think of a solution: We could remove the "use" line and add the \nversion to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines \n  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; \n  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); \nto do per hand what \'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45\' does automagically; `perl \nMakefile.PL` will die with a "Uncaught exception from user code: \nExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at \nMakefile.PL line 103." there but we\'ve got a Makefile. But I don\'t know if \nCPAN will run the make anyway... \n \n> To add insult to injury, the PM_FILTER part gets run during pm_to_blib,  \n> which would be fine, except ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn\'t let you write a  \n> MY::pm_to_blib - it\'s non-overridable! So even though we could  \n> potentially copy the 5.45 ExtUtils::Install::pm_to_blib code somewhere  \n> into the spamassassin codebase (I tried that first), we can\'t cause the  \n> Makefile to call our code :-( \n \nWe could call the preprocessor on install time. That\'s not a very clean \napproach but could work. \n \nWe can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We \nalready have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. Adding \nsome commands in this section gives some make warnings ("Makefile:933: \nwarning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib\' Makefile:877: warning: \nignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib\'") but does work. Not a very good \nsolution either. \n \n> So I\'m *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45  \n> usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and  \n> really hope we can find another way. \n \nThe "use MakeMaker::..." error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it\'s ok \nto require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA \ninstallation.

I think this should be split up into different\nnumbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can\nget different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From\nnames that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or\nmore digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a\nsingle digit, just the sake of completeness.\n\nHere is what I got:\n\nOVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME\n  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)\n100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)\n  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6\n  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5\n  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4\n  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3\n  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2\n  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1\n\nI should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably\nbecause so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo!

If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not\nsupport it, that\'s a serious problem with the business model; but that is\nnobody\'s problem but Habeas\'s.\n\nA possible solution is for Habeas\'s business model to include some kind of\nincentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet\nto think of an incentive that fits the bill ...\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:\n\n> I don\'t see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan\'s\n> points.\n> \n>   - high score: as far as I can see, that\'s because SpamAssassin is\n>     assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days, and the\n>     Habeas mark has to bring it down below that. :(   IMO we have to fix\n>     the high-scorers anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over 5 in our\n>     scoring system, 5 == tagged anyway.\n\nThis is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all\nits incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject\nat SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  \nIf some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,\nthere\'d better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their\nthresholds to 5.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Michael Moncur wrote:\n\n> But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that\n> frequently hit on newsletters.

Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor\nof at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message\nbasis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.\n\nOn Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Harold Hallikainen wrote:\n\n> Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle\n> spam.

There\'s nobody\nleft to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their\nwill because their mail won\'t get through otherwise) to use the mark.\n\nConversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to\nmake all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose\nfor which it was designed.\n\nEither way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against\nreal spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,\nthen either (a) they\'re out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights\nto use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they\'ve both\ncreated and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" that\neverybody has to pay them for.\n\nThe latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do\nabsolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with\nlawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly\nfrom everyone on the internet -- effectively we\'ll be paying them for the\nprivilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don\'t believe they\'ll\never get that far, but I don\'t particularly want to help them make it.\n\n[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could \nconsist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n'

I don't think the\n   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,\n   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.\n\n2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects\n   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA\n   tuning and development.\n\n3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off\n   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology\n   (by both spammers and non-spammers).\n\nThe second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa\nsignature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used\nby SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or\nSHA-1 of each file).\n\nThe third problem doesn't really worry me.\n\nThese problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique\nto spam filtering.

'\n\nI\'m not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail\nproblem. Here\'s the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning\nFreeBSD 4.4.

"\n\nHi,\n\nNewbie (to the list) question;  I've been working on porting the code to\nrun under Perl on Windows.  The changes are fairly minor and can be made\nto interoperate with the current code.  How would one best go about\ngetting those changes merged in (better question, would there be\ninterest in such a version and getting those changes merged in)?\n\nBill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it\neasy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything\nup...

If\nyou want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this\nin your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.\n\n  score RAZOR_CHECK 10\n\nThe default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.\nTherefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA\nthen setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5\nwould be sufficient.\n\nIf you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.\nOtherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once\nfor SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor\nindividually then you should set the \'score RAZOR_CHECK 0\' so that SA\nwon\'t do it and avoid the double network hit.\n\nHowever, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has\nbeen the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The\ncurrent score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.\nBut for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.\nRazor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide\nof use as Razor1.\n\nBob\n\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\nContent-Disposition: inline\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQE9iV7k0pRcO8E2ULYRAjoAAJ97CB6LpbhPHqa8IJx1l4g/LRiVdwCfUZIB\nkUAK30zsRWL8PTb1TrEQuy8=\n=XVm6\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n--huq684BweRXVnRxX--\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n'

'\n\nHi,\n\nI was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a\nbase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base\nimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes\nchanges to its own "redo" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance\nincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the\ncurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.\n\nThis is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the\nhoneypots mailing list)\nhttp://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html\n\nCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server\napplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,\neven before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.\n\nThe physical architectures of most production client/server systems are\nlayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server\nrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net\nbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one\nof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database\nserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one\npartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the\npartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from\none boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap\nspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.\n\nWhen someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that\nshouldn\'t be changed.

'\n\nI did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years\nago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don\'t\nrecall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image\nof some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is\nintrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is\nnot graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary\nif you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.\nThere have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the\nearly 1980s if not before.\n\nA generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement\nsnapshots on top of an existing filesystem.

'\n\nthe only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the\nuniverse. too big to decrypt.\n\nmy point is there will never be a "safe" key. what I would consider is how\nlong does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for\nlonger than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to\nstop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what\nis available on the market.

Even if you are\nfortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you\nstill can\'t fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of\nstatic multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be\nalleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best\nwhich will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard\ndrives become cheaper.\n\n>> Obviously, you can\'t do this with partitions that accrue important\n>> state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.\n\n>... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a\n>mountable writable partition.

This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term\nsignificance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static\napplication code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large\nclient/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because\nthese are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different\nsets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also\ntend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular\nwith the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence\nservices at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a\nphysical architecture that has a static web server, a static application\nserver, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions.

If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then\nmarket this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that\nrely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer\noverflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized\nmodification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this\nparticular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend\napplication data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself\nhas not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could\nhelp.\n\nI would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a\nhardware RAID vendor to implement.

The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and\noutput) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly\ndesigned systems and/or algorithm.

As Michael \npointed out, there\'s something of an arms-race between manufacturers and \nattackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again \nwhat we\'ve seen is that it\'s not a question of "is it secure", it\'s a \nquestion of "who is it secure from and for how long?" Security is rarely a \nquestion of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather \nit\'s a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk.

One might expect a bored undergrad EE student \nto have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, \nsay, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad \nEEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is \nlikely "trustworthy" enough for your application.

"\n\nHi everybody!\n\nI'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database \naccess with postgreSQL).\n\nThis will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a \nframework for other web applications.\n\nThe application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.\n\nI would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the \ndatabase, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.\n\nAbove all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.\n\nA problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for \nencryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \n\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.\n\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\n\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \nAfter all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to \nlearn methods and technics.\n\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\n\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \ndb connection/password to the main web application.\n\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \nbackground).\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThank you,\nMario Torre\n-- \nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \n\n"

Assuming very little spam comes through, we\nonly need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training\nham to match the new training spam.

I\nlike the general approach that copies of random messages will be\nsequestered for some period of time before they\'re assumed to be ham.\nMatched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the\ntraining up to date with little effort.

I don\'t want to use ZODB, as I\'d like something a\nperson can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is\nlooking like my best option.\n\nI already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy\'s SpamOracle, which\ndoes the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new\nheader, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.\n\nHere\'s how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:\n\n  train-eggs\n  train-spam\n  trained-eggs\n  trained-spam\n\nYou copy all your spam and eggs* into the "train-" boxes as you get it.\nHow frequently you do this would be up to you, but you\'d get better\nresults if you did it more often, and you\'d be wise to always copy over\nanything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy\nswoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of\nthings you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she\'s\ndone, she moves your mail into the "trained-" folders.\n\nThis would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read\ntheir mail right off the server.  I\'ve spoken with some fellows at work\nabout Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports\nappropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.\n\nAdvanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail\nclient to bind the key "S" to "move to train-spam" and "H" to "move to\ntrain-eggs".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it\'d\nstart showing up in mail clients.  That\'s the "delete as spam" button\nPaul Graham was talking about.\n\n* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word "ham" as the\n  opposite of "spam", and they\'ve been amazingly cool about the use of\n  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling\n  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as\n  "eggs".\n\nNeale\n'

'\n\nI think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all\nPython platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.\n\nMac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that\'s unlikely\nto offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even\nL|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to\ntheir MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)\n\nMy notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a\nclient-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I\'m only\ngoing to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams\nthe incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The\nMUA accesses this "eThunk" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is\nretained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual\noversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)\nand the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA\nfetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for \'always online\' users, but I am not\nclear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.\n\nOutbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all\nMUAs can split the host fetch/send URL\'s\n\nIMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If\nthis is available, the "simple viewer" could be enhanced to support viewing\nvia folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would\nuse this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best\nn-way classifier uses something called a "Support Vector Machine" (SVM)\nwhich is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).\n\nI wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves\nthe fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could\nbe dropped into whatever harness that suited the user\'s situation.\n\nDavid LeBlanc\nSeattle, WA USA\n\n\n'

With that same message base, the dbm\nfile weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:\n\n  Using a database:\n   real    8m24.741s\n   user    6m19.410s\n   sys     1m33.650s\n\n  Using a pickle:\n   real    1m39.824s\n   user    1m36.400s\n   sys     0m2.160s\n\nThis is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to\nbe, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).\n\nFor comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at\nleast for speed) on the same data blazes along:\n\n   real    0m29.592s\n   user    0m28.050s\n   sys     0m1.180s\n\nIts data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.\nHowever, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing\nalgorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be\nable to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.\n\nI don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I\ndo, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores\nevery word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any\ncase, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  \n\nOn the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking\ndown to 1.8MB.\n\nNeale\n"
"\n\n[Tim]\n> My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is\n> approaching 10 million bytes.\n\nThat shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo\nrecords with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records\naren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of\nUNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted\nbefore that a scoring-only database can be leaner.\n\nIn part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the\ndatabase is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part\ndue to plain evil gremlins.\n\n"

I wonder how much better you could do by using some\ncustom pickler.  I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of\nwhat I would call bloat:\n\n  >>> import anydbm, hammie\n  >>> d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes("ham.db")\n  >>> db = anydbm.open("ham.db")\n  >>> db["neale"], len(db["neale"])\n  (\'ccopy_reg\\n_reconstructor\\nq\\x01(cclassifier\\nWordInfo\\nq\\x02c__builtin__\\nobject\\nq\\x03NtRq\\x04(GA\\xce\\xbc{\\xfd\\x94\\xbboK\\x00K\\x00K\\x00G?\\xe0\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00tb.\', 106)\n  >>> d.wordinfo["neale"], len(`d.wordinfo["neale"]`)\n  (WordInfo\'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)\', 42)\n\nIgnoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled\nversion of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string\nrepresentation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using\nthe string representation instead of the pickle, right?\n\nSomething about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can\'t see what it\nis.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every\nvalue of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there\'s a\nton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.\n\nNeale\n'

The received and date headers helped the\nclassifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is\nnew.\n\nSo I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,\nand x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-\nheaders that my mail reader added:\n\nclass MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):\n\n    skip = {\'received\': 1,\n            \'date\': 1,\n            \'x-from_\': 1,\n            }\n\n    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):\n        for k, v in msg.items():\n            k = k.lower()\n            if k in self.skip or k.startswith(\'x-vm\'):\n                continue\n            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):\n                for t in tokenize_word(w):\n                    yield "%s:%s" % (k, t)\n\nThis did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the\ntests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test\nrun that used the timtest header tokenizer.\n\nIt\'s interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham\ndiscriminators.  There\'s not a single spam-indicator in the list.\nMost of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is\nthat the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam\nindicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of\nMailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing\nspam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use\nXEmacs.  That\'s probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).\n\nOne final note.

What you seemed to\nshow is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so\nhelped (the "after" numbers are better than the "before" numbers, right?).\nAssuming that what you did was override what\'s now\ntokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn\'t\ncall the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you\'re missing\ncarefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many\ndozens of other header fields.  There\'s no question that adding more header\nfields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn\'t do so only\nbecause my testing corpora are such that I can\'t add more headers without\ngetting major benefits for bogus reasons.\n\nApart from all that, you said you\'re skipping Received.  By several\naccounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I\'m\n(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the\nreason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer\nreported good results from this scheme:\n\n    ip_re = re.compile(r\'(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3})\')\n\n    for header in msg.get_all("received", ()):\n        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):\n            parts = ip.split(".")\n            for n in range(1, 5):\n                yield \'received:\' + \'.\'.join(parts[:n])\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled\nfor now.\n\n'

The clues below are *loaded* with snippets unique to HTML (like \'<br>\').\n\nI *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01\nclues.  But that\'s wrong too!

All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are\nsaved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.\nThen the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of\nclues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)\nis then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of\nthem.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final\nprobability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list\nof clues (else you\'d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;\nand massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual\nreview is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer\nMAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that\'s\nwhy you didn\'t see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.\n\nBefore adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and\n0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to\nappear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.\n\n>> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!\n\n> This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few\n> similar ones.\n\nI just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores\npunctuation, and strips a trailing \'s\' from words, and saves both word\nbigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a\nlist of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.\n\n> I wonder if there\'s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and\nthe\n> HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in the sidebar, but the\nbody\n> text was a serious discussion of "OO and soft coding" with lots of highly\n> technical words as clues (including Zope and ZEO).\n\nNo matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.\nDitto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique "words" that get\n0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of\nconditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the\nprobability that "<body>" appears in a message is highly correlated with the\nprob of "<br>" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes\ngrossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you\nget in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.\n\nRead the "What about HTML?" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,\nI\'ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at\npython.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to\njustify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven\'t done anything\ngeared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email\nthat happens to go through python.org.\n\nI\'d prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it\nstill had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test\nresults with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the "What about\nHTML?" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,\n\n# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here\n# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.\n\nand we\'ve since done several things that gave significant f-n rate\nreductions.  I should test that again now.\n\n> Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?\n\nAlmost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both\nheaders and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base\ntokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.\n\n> Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make\n> progress there?\n\nI would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman\nheader decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging\nthe data is a Mortal Sin and I haven\'t changed a byte so far), and my spam\ntoo polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In\nparticular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they\'re\ngoing to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don\'t even catch\n"undisclosed recipients" in the To header now!).\n\n> ...\n> No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:\n>\n>   multipart/mixed\n>       text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))\n>       text/html         (long HTML copied from website)\n\nAh!  That explains why the HTML tags didn\'t get stripped.  I\'d again offer\nto add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they\'d get stripped here\ntoo, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like\na loss <wink>.\n\n>> This seems confused: Jeremy didn\'t use my trained classifier pickle,\n>> he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.\n>> ...\n\n> I think it\'s still corpus size.\n\nI reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from\nmy corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting\non sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error\nrates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of\neach.\n\n\nAh, a full test run just finished, on the\n\n   tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips\na\n   trailing \'s\' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams\n\nThis is the code:\n\n            # Tokenize everything in the body.\n            lastw = \'\'\n            for w in word_re.findall(text):\n                n = len(w)\n                # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().\n                if 3 <= n <= 12:\n                    if w[-1] == \'s\':\n                        w = w[:-1]\n                    yield w\n                    if lastw:\n                        yield lastw + w\n                    lastw = w + \' \'\n\n                elif n >= 3:\n                    lastw = \'\'\n                    for t in tokenize_word(w):\n                        yield t\n\nwhere\n\n    word_re = re.compile(r"[\\w$\\-\\x80-\\xff]+")\n\nThis at least doubled the process size over what\'s done now.

'\n\nNeil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.\nWe\'re missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);\nthe "before custom fiddling" figures on the 3 reported runs were:\n\n    false positive percentages\n        0.187\n        0.749\n        0.780\n    total unique fp 19\n\n    false negative percentages\n        2.072\n        2.448\n        0.574\n    total unique fn 43\n\nThe "total unique" figures counts all 6 runs; it\'s just the individual-run\nfp and fn percentages we\'re missing for 3 runs.\n\nJeremy reported these "before custom fiddling" figures on 4 sets with about\n600 ham and spam in each:\n\n    false positive percentages\n        0.000\n        1.398\n        1.398\n        0.000\n        1.242\n        1.242\n        1.398\n        1.398\n        0.000\n        1.553\n        1.553\n        0.000\n    total unique fp 139\n\n    false negative percentages\n       10.413\n        6.104\n        5.027\n        8.259\n        2.873\n        5.745\n        5.206\n        4.488\n        9.336\n        5.206\n        5.027\n        9.874\n    total unique fn 970\n\nSo things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported\nsignificant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header\nlines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer\'s header\nanalysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer\'s header analysis completely\nbut added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all\nheader lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all\nthose starting with \'x-vm\').\n\nWhen I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I\nsee:\n\n    false positive percentages\n        0.000\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.000\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.400\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.000\n        0.200\n        0.400\n        0.000\n        0.400\n        0.200\n        0.600\n    total unique fp 10\n\n    false negative percentages\n        0.800\n        0.400\n        0.200\n        0.600\n        1.000\n        0.000\n        0.600\n        1.200\n        1.200\n        0.800\n        0.400\n        0.800\n        1.800\n        0.800\n        0.400\n        1.000\n        1.000\n        0.400\n        0.000\n        0.600\n    total unique fn 36\n\nThis is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run\non a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to\n12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random\npairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I\'m pretty confident that it\'s\nnot going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.\n\nIt\'s hard to conclude anything given Jeremy\'s much worse results.  If they\nwere in line with Neil\'s results, I\'d suspect that I\'ve over-tuned the\nalgorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.\n\n'

'\n\n[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you\'re specifically\n concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]\n\nOK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and\n/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that\nI can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment\'s notice.  For the\nrecord, here\'s how it all works:\n\n  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file\n    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any "junk mail\n    condition" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)\n    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it\n    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as\n    "message from known spammer" (reject after every RCPT TO command),\n    "no message-id header", and "8-bit chars in subject" (both rejected\n    after the message headers/body are read).\n\n    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest\n    are:\n      - don\'t check for 8-bit chars in "From" header -- the vast\n        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some\n        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin\n      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there\'s a\n        verifiable email address in at least one of "From", "Reply-to",\n        and "Sender") as late as possible, because it requires DNS\n        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that\n        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS\n        lookups timeout)\n\n  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those\n    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients\n    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This\n    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder\n    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the\n    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject\n    the message.\n\n    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now\n    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name\n    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the\n    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is\n    retained in saved messages.)\n\n    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py\n    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew\n    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows\n    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is\n    basically this:\n      if virus:\n          folder = "virus"\n      else:\n          run through SpamAssassin\n          if score >= 10.0:\n              folder = "rejected-spam"\n          elif score >= 5.0:\n              folder = "caught-spam"\n\n    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.\n    By far the biggest folder will be "accepted" -- the server handles\n    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk\n    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven\'t written the code that actually\n    saves the message -- d\'ohh!  Also haven\'t written anything to\n    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)\n\n  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you\'ve read the message\n    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,\n    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)\n    don\'t consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep\n    retrying.  D\'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair\n    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,\n    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)\n    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called\n    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB\n    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When\n    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --\n    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by\n    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry\n    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there\'s an ACL in exim4.conf\n    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there\'s a record for the\n    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn\'t expired yet, we\n    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or\n    body.\n\n    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is\n    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP\n    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This\n    is a win if you\'re just thinking about reducing server load and\n    bandwidth, but I\'m not sure if it\'s helpful for training spam\n    detectors.

If \'bayes.ini\' isn\'t found, *none* of the\noptions will be defined.

A skip token is produced in lieu\nof "word" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It\'s\npossible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.\nHowever, if you\'re running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tags\ndefaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before body\ntokenization.\n\n'

For instance, the following message:\n\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\nFrom: somebody <someone@somewhere.org>\nTo: neale@woozle.org\nSubject: Booga\nContent-type: multipart/alternative; boundary="snot"\n\nThis is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n--snot\nContent-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-transfer-encoding: 7BIT\n\nHi there.\n--snot\nContent-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-transfer-encoding: 7BIT\n\n<pre>Hi there.</pre>\n--snot--\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\n\nComes out like this:\n\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\nFrom: somebody <someone@somewhere.org>\nTo: neale@woozle.org\nSubject: Booga\nContent-type: multipart/alternative; boundary="snot"\nX-Hammie-Disposition: No; 0.74; [unrelated gar removed]\n\nThis is a multi-part message in MIME format.\n\n--snot\n\n--snot--\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\n\nI\'m using "Python 2.3a0 (#1, Sep  9 2002, 22:56:24)".\n\nI\'ve fixed it with the following patch to Tim\'s tokenizer, but I have to\nadmit that I\'m baffled as to why it works.  Maybe there\'s some subtle\ninteraction between generators and lists that I can\'t understand.  Or\nsomething.  Being as I\'m baffled, I don\'t imagine any theory I come up\nwith will be anywhere close to reality.\n\nIn any case, be advised that (at least for me) hammie will eat\nmultipart/alternative messages until this patch is applied.  The patch\nseems rather bogus though, so I\'m not checking it in, in the hope that\nthere\'s a better fix I just wasn\'t capable of discovering :)\n\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\nIndex: tokenizer.py\n===================================================================\nRCS file: /cvsroot/spambayes/spambayes/tokenizer.py,v\nretrieving revision 1.15\ndiff -u -r1.15 tokenizer.py\n--- tokenizer.py\t10 Sep 2002 18:15:49 -0000\t1.15\n+++ tokenizer.py\t11 Sep 2002 05:01:16 -0000\n@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@\n+#! /usr/bin/env python\n """Module to tokenize email messages for spam filtering."""\n \n import email\n@@ -507,7 +508,8 @@\n             htmlpart = textpart = None\n             stack = part.get_payload()\n             while stack:\n-                subpart = stack.pop()\n+                subpart = stack[0]\n+                stack = stack[1:]\n                 ctype = subpart.get_content_type()\n                 if ctype == \'text/plain\':\n                     textpart = subpart\n------------------------------8<------------------------------\n\n\n'

They were all getting married within a \nshort time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex \nlife would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard \nfrom the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. \n\nThe first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The \ncard said nothing but "Maxwell House".  Mom was puzzled at first, but \nthen went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: "Good till \nthe last drop." Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. \n\nThe second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, \nand the card read: "Benson & Hedges".  Mom now knew to go straight to \nher husband\'s cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: \n"Extra Long, King Size".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still \nhappy for her daughter. \n\nThe third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for \na week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a \nwhole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky \nhandwriting were the words: "British Airways".  Mom took out her latest \nHarper\'s Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, \nand finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: "Three times a \nday, seven days a week, both ways." \n\nMom fainted. \n\n\n'

Then the penny\ndropped. It didn\'t occur to the Germans that this might happen. It\ncaused great amusement."\n\nThe firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about £200.\n\nA Virgin spokeswoman said: "Those determined to join the Mile High\nClub will do so despite the lack of comforts.\n\n"We don\'t mind couples having a good time but this is not something\nthat we would encourage because of air regulations."\n\nThe new Airbus is the world\'s longest airliner, with teasing slogan\n"Mine is bigger than yours". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far\nEast and the US.\n\n\n'
"\n\n\nForwarded-by: Flower\n\nDid you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is\nsexually active or not?\n\n1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman\n   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes\n   hair shiny and skin smooth.\n\n2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering\n   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses\n   the pores and makes your skin glow.\n\n3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that\n   romantic dinner.\n\n4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches\n   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable\n   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!\n\n5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body\n   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and\n   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.\n\n6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually\n   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called\n   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!\n\n7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE\n   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.\n\n8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages\n   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid\n   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.\n\n9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release\n   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.\n\n10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national\n    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.\n\nENJOY SEX!\n\n\n"

'\n\n\nForwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>\nFrom: Bert\n\n01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn\'t a boy...  I\'d have had\n    nothing to play with.\n\n02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, "Come on over; nobody\'s\n    home."  I went over. Nobody was home.\n\n03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the\n    other night she called me from a hotel\n\n04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging\n    naked. I said to the guy, "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?"  He\n    said "Because you came home early."\n\n05. It\'s been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on\n    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle\n    came off.  I\'m afraid to go to the bathroom.\n\n06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat\n    kept covering me up.\n\n07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and\n    radio.\n\n08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She\n    told me that she only liked me as a friend.\n\n09. I\'m so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who\n    came with his wallet.\n\n10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to\n    my father, "I\'m sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled\n    through."\n\n11. I\'m so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was\n    born.\n\n12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of\n    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.\n\n13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me\n    find my parents. I said to him, "Do you think we\'ll ever find\n    them?" He said,"I don\'t know kid. There\'s so many places they can\n    hide."\n\n14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.\n\n15. I\'m so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how\n    big I\'d get.\n\n16. I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and\n    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What\'s wrong\n    with me?" He said...  "I don\'t know but your eyesight is perfect."\n\n17. I went to the doctor because I\'d swallowed a bottle of sleeping\n    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.\n\n18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, "How can I get my\n    kite in the air?" He told me to run off a cliff.\n\n19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves\n    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on\n    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.\n\n20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.\n\n21. My uncle\'s dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in\n    the electric chair.\n\n\n'

Even then, those relics were\nwell on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.\n  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than\n$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.\n  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts\nhave banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.\n  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.\n  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,\nruns on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has\nbeen hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away\nfrom the Microsoft monopoly.\n\n...\n\n     - http://finance.lycos.com/home/news/story.asp?story=28928829\n\n\n"

The resulting \ncomputers are sent to the developing world for activist use. \n\n    For the Amazonian villages where there\'s no electricity or where phone \n    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the \n    nearby cities.

Because none of the computers are \n    being sold in Ecuador, and because they\'re being transferred from an \n    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won\'t be charged any \n    international shipping duties on the computers.

If the industry moved to a \n    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the \n    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to \n    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an \n    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic \n    shakeout in Webcasting is "inevitable and desirable because it will bring \n    about market consolidation." That\'s really it in a nutshell. "Market \n    consolidation" means the less artists they have to promote, the less \n    ultimate dollars they\'ll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the \n    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because \n    that\'s all you\'ll be able to find out there.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2]\n\n[1] http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/09/23/133228\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/8nEQCxZaP8U6X\n\n\n'

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \nother things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum.

You can once again reach me \nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \n\nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \nvocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so \ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \n\nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \nquestions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in \nmy RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file \nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \nfeed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \ndictionary.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.peerfear.org/\n\n\n"

Jason \nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn\'t a protest as such, more of an inside \njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \ngeneral) is to make everyone\'s words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody\'s \nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. \n\n_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format \nformerly known as RSS&#8221;.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \n\nIn its first day, I\'ve already noticed: \n\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth\'s \nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google\'s coverage is what is a news \nsite, and what isn\'t. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \n- Big companies spend mucho money paying "clipping services" that send them \ncopies of any press coverage they receive.

That\'s actually an interesting \nproject with some potential for success, but at this point I\'m sick of the \nwhole thing, so I\'ll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; \n- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. \n&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal \nwith data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? \nNeed a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides?

RDF adds another layer of \ntedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make \nheavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in \nRDF.

That was pretty good. My heart \nwas racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive \nultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head \nwith blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not \ndiseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general \nartery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they \nwere sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the \nheart). \n\nNow there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very \nwell. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I \nasked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does \nit mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really \nnot much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the \nones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an \nangiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass \nbecause of this is small. That's quite a relief.

'\n\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617\nDate: Not supplied\n\nA lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the \nresponses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something \nhere: if you think Mozilla\'s current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not \nthe target audience for Phoenix.\n\nHere is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.\n\n\n- The link toolbar is: \n\n\n- critical to my day-to-day use \n- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn\'t everybody use Bugzilla?\n-  link what?\n\n\n\n- The sidebar is \n\n\n- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution \n- not cool enough, since i can\'t float and dock all my panels and have \nsplitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML \npanels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... \n- a waste of real estate\n\n\n\n- Form auto-fill \n\n\n- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information \nfirst \n- should just happen automatically\n\n\n\n- Downloads \n\n\n- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! \n- should be clearly visible and understandable.\n\n\n\n- Toolbars should \n\n\n- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the \nwindow, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be \nable to edit existing buttons\' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be \nable to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and \ncontext menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file \nsystem and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and \nmow my lawn and... \n- be customizable within reason\n\n\n\n- Composer should \n\n\n- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. \nEverywhere! \n- not be part of a Web browser.\n\n\n\n- Mail should \n\n\n- be part of my browser program. Aren\'t they the same app? There is a \ndifference? \n- be a separate application.\n\n\n\n\nNow to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, \nyou can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to \nthe "optional add-on" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or \nmouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them \nyourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will \nfacilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an \nalarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should \nautomatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. \n\nWhy? \n\nA layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become \nas complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The \ngeek features aren\'t inflicted on you by default.\n\nFinally, remember that Phoenix\'s UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an \nopportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the \nbrowser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the \nuser interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions \nwithin Netscape.\n\n[1] http://www.mozillanews.org\n[2] http://www.mozillazine.org\n\n\n'
'\n\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841\nDate: Not supplied\n\nBug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It\'s a pretty basic \nbrowser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified \nbrowsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 \nand his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time \nslightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla\'s no tolerance \npolicy for regressions.\n\nWhile this "line in the sand" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it \nmisses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to \nadd features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see \nfeatures removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, \nrelying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the \nuser interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last \nfeature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!\n\nYou can really only cram so many features into a product before its size \nrequirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious \nrule. It\'s like you start with an empty elevator that says "Capacity: 10 \npeople." The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of \npeople (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the \nsecond floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it \ncontinues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, \nbut there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of \nthem squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla \nsidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes \nhe\'d get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn\'t. \nSomeone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way \nto the third floor, so he\'s useless, and everyone wishes he\'d get off too. He \ndoesn\'t though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until \neventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.\n\nWe need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that \nnobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the \nfeatures that didn\'t work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren\'t there in \nMozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want \nsome of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go \ndownload them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat \nwill we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.\n\n\n'

'\n\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355\nDate: Not supplied\n\nBlake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to \nadmit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, "Do you \nreally agree with mpt\'s Top 10 list? He\'s quoted you at the top of the list!"\n\nDo I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of \ncourse not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in \nmind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily \nagreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas \nregarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is \nan issue that needs to be addressed. That\'s something.\n\nTo cover the list specifically:\n\n\n- Navigator chrome structure - While I don\'t necessarily agree with mpt\'s \nproposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is \npainfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in \norder for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.\n\n- Speed - can\'t argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the \nuseless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain \nspeed.\n\n- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you\'ll see that the textfield \nwidget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It\'s buggy, \nslow, misbehaves, and doesn\'t edit the way you\'d expect. This is IMO Chimera\'s \ntop usability problem.\n\n- Message display - Yes. No argument here.\n\n- Search - Yeah, it\'s a mess. Don\'t know if it would be in my top ten, but it\'s \na mess.\n\n- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be \nseparated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with \nmultiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., \nyou can eliminate the New submenu easily).\n\n- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.\n\n- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS \ndefault on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. \nIf you don\'t like it, complain about Win32, but don\'t cite this as a Mozilla \nusability problem when we\'re following the conventions of the operating system. \n(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 \nwants to fire it.)\n\n- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is \ncompletely irrelevant.\n\n- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a \ntangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique \ndialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly \nhalf the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously \noverconfigurable.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/2002_08_18_index.html#80418641\n[2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com\n\n\n'

'\n\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nWe\'re trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. \nHistorically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get \nabused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything \nthey think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. \nEnd result: people don\'t enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not \ncapturing all that information. You can always "page fault" to get the \ninformation if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in \nevery bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine \n(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be \nrelevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the \nprogrammer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be \ndll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking \nfor the DLL info? Similarly, it\'s always tempting to add a field in which you \nask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but \ntrust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing \nonly: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first \nplace. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can \nalways include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be \nrelevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on \nWindows 98SE? Aha! You can\'t. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not \nevery bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so \nthis search doesn\'t make sense in the first place. The info wasn\'t captured. Do \na full text search for 98SE and you\'ll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) \n\nLife would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of \ninformation -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on \nthe computer in question and while you\'re at it, a photograph of the tester\'s \nworkspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, \nwhich, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I \nhave heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking \npackage was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the \nsystem, because they didn\'t know what all those fields were. The _real_ \nbug-"tracking" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. \n\nA pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, "does \nFogBUGZ support custom fields?" Rather than giving our usual answer ("no. on \npurpose.") over the last few weeks I\'ve been saying, "can you please tell me \nwhat fields you would need? We\'re trying to decide whether to implement that \nfeature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it." The interesting thing \nis, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the \nother ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn\'t be fields. And in fact, our \nexisting customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our \nbiggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted \nto add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, \nbut I didn\'t, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track \nof it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are \nhappy and keep buying more site licenses. \n\nBut the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking \nsoftware and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in \nour product. "Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields." Righto. It\'s true. And \nwho am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to \nyesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a \nbuilt-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and \ninconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But \nit\'s still rude of me to tell customers that we don\'t have that feature _for \ntheir own good_, even though it usually is, and we\'re losing some sales because \nof it. \n\nSigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so \nhard to use that people don\'t use it. At least we won\'t lose any sales :)\n\n[1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\n\n\n'

"\n\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my \nearlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published \na report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for \nchildren. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.\n\nBuffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like \nGTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply \nwarning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is \na belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of \nprimetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should \nair during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to \nrestrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The \nshows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and \nsome aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents \nand children wish to watch TV together during this hour.\n\nIt should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television \nviewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then \ndon't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or \nshoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because \nyou don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let \nyour kids watch it.\n\nThe PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example \nof one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show \ninappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems \nappropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their \nultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that \nall other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.\n\n[1] http://www.parentstv.org/\n\n\n"

'\n\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nDaniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to \nOS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people \nwho pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small \nfraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people \nwho are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn\'t successful, the Mac is _\nover_. It\'s not like System 9 is getting any more popular. \n\nThen again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right \nbusiness decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac \nis not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on \nNetscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share \nof Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) \n\nRobb Beal wrote[4]: "Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company \nwith a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it\'s \na Mac application a net plus? (No.)" Well _duh_. Your product would have to \nappeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just \nto break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 \nWindows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same \namount of money. \n\nNow, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. \nThat\'s fine. If you like Macs and you\'re doing it for fun, more power to ya. \n\nBut as long as we\'re talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you\'re going \nto get 25 times as many users. Maybe there\'s less competition in your category \non the Mac; maybe you\'re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs \ndominate (they don\'t, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people \nin big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can\'t sell to mixed \nenvironments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment \nin Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you\'re going to overcome that \nmagic 25 multiplier.\n\n[1] http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/2002/09/10\n[2] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0207/03.marketshare.php\n[3] http://websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?corporate&news&press_1_193\n[4] http://radio.weblogs.com/0001123/2002/04/10.html\n\n\n'

'\n\nURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This \nexcerpt was rather amusing.\n\n_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better \nbrowser than Navigator. For example, Netscape\'s best new feature, tabbed \nbrowsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser \nwindow, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in \nMozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called \nMultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, \nYecies, of Netscape, said, "That\'s true, but the engineer who\'s working on it \n[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of \nfostering general browsing usability for Netscape." \n_\nYes, ok, I suppose that\'s true if by "Netscape employee" you really meant \n"Apple employee." and by "always done with the intention of fostering general \nbrowsing usability for Netscape" you meant "was done in a weekend for Mozilla \nbecause I thought MultiZilla was cool." \n\nHere\'s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally \ndownloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I \nwas particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed \nbrowsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed \nbrowser that embedded WinIE. \n\nMultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that \nprevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was \na UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last \ncontext menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been \ndefinite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor\'s more obscure \ncapabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that \nthe tab behavior wasn\'t encapsulated cleanly into a widget. \n\nI produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a \nweekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that \nencapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files \nwould be minimal. Once I established that it didn\'t degrade performance in the \nsingle tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.\n\nThe response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So \nmuch so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was \noverruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) \nEven with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed \nbrowsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still \ndidn\'t get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that \nnobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They \ncontinued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity \nthat one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn\'t know what to make \nof it.\n\nOnly after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I\'m sure \nNetscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can\'t you just see it \nnow? We\'ll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and \ntwenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. \n\nCan you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say "you \nshould do this" or "you should do that", they get completely ignored (or blown \noff), but when CNet says "We didn\'t like this, or we didn\'t like that.", \nNetscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.\n\n[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/\n[2] http://www.salon.com\n[3] http://www.mozdev.org\n[4] http://www.netcaptor.com\n\n\n'

'\n\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85506002\nDate: Not supplied\n\nAfter the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science \nfiction writers\' workshop at Bruce Sterling\'s place. Turkey City is a venerable \nscience fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of \nscience fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding \nwhat works and what doesn\'t in a work of science fiction: \n\n    Squid on the Mantelpiece \n\n    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the \n    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot \n    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic \n    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming \n    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It\'s hard to \n    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad\'s bank overdraft when \n    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the \n    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF\'s extreme, grotesque, or visionary \n    thematics is known as the "squid on the mantelpiece." \n\n    Card Tricks in the Dark \n\n    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private \n    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia \n    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and \n    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. \n    (Attr.

'\n\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85505995\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI\'ve been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas \nabout EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he \nblogged the hell out of the talk: \n\n    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano \n    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), \n    "the Betamax affair"... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax \n    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would \n    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the \n    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the \n    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a \n    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. \n    This principle is under attack. \n\n    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright \n    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits \n    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content \n    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, \n    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial \n    for creating a piece of code.  \n\nLink[1] (Wes blogged it, too[2]) Discuss[3]\n\n[1] http://www.weblogsky.com/2002_09_01_blarchive.html#85500802\n[2] http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/09/27\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/4rEePy7RSm38x\n\n\n'
