'\n\nHello\n\nYou may have seen this business before and\nignored it. I know I did - many times! However,\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\n\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\n\nI\'ll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\nto one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething just said: "You throw away $25.00 going to\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\ndoing had I not. Read on. It\'s true. Every word of it.\nIt is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying\nand selling something of value.\n\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:\n\nMaking over half a million dollars every 4 to 5\nmonths from your home.\n\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!\n==================================================\nBE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!\n\nBefore you say "Bull", please read the following.\nThis is the letter you have been hearing about on the\nnews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\npeople money.

To assist you with marketing your business\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\nventure going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\'s also assume\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\'s\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders. That\'s 100 people who\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\n(half a million dollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\n==================================================\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\ne-mails each or more?\n\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\njust that, and more!\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\'s it.\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\nthe report.\n\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\nThe reason for the "cash" is not because this is\nillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\nit before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\n2 sheets of paper.

My wife, Jody and I live in\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\nreceiving \'junk mail\'. I made fun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I \'knew\' it wouldn\'t work.\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n\'I told you so\' on her when the thing didn\'t work. \n\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \'hobby\'."\n\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n================================================\n"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn\'t get enough orders to at least get\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \n\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\'t a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big."\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=================================================\n"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks."\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=================================================\n"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\neasy money with little cost to you.

One of the people you send this\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\nname will be on every one of them. \n\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\n\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\n"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\nreceiving \'junk mail\'. I made fun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I \'knew\' it wouldn\'t work.\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n\'I told you so\' on her when the thing didn\'t work. \n\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \'hobby\'."\n\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n================================================\n"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn\'t get enough orders to at least get\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \n\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\'t a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big."\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=================================================\n"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks."\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=================================================\n"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet."\n\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n=================================================\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\n\n=================================================\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \n\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\nof our technical ability.\n\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\nnever be used again.\n\n\n'

'\n\nHi,\n\nI\'m a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \nI\'m ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\n\nIn a minute I\'m going to tell you my secret,\nit\'s the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\n\nYou\'ve probably heard stories about people making\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\nboy-geniuses.\n\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\n\nIt\'s people like you and me that are making the real\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\n\nEver since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \ntechnique ever created - it\'s called BULK EMAIL.\n\nIf you\'ve ever recieved an email advertisement, then \nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can\'t click on \nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \nguarantee it.  Now let\'s go back to Math 101 and \nreview some numbers ...\n\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\nZERO!\n\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\n\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \nof work.  \n\nIt\'s that simple ...\n\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you\'re FILTHY RICH.\n\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn\'t \nmatter if you\'re a nineteen-year-old college student \nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \nexecutive working from an office building in New \nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\n\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \n"Dot Com" mania, and I\'ve never looked back.  I \nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \n\nYou don\'t need any money.  You don\'t need a product.\nYou don\'t need to be a computer nerd and no experience\nwhatsoever is required.  \n\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\nyou\'d jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\nSo what are you waiting for?!\n\nI\'m going to ask you four simple questions.

'\n\nHi -\n\n( http://club.4tfox.com )\n\nYou get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.\nMost of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.\nAnd they expect you to listen to them?\n\nEnough.\n\nIf you want to make money with your computer, then you should\nhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making\na large, continuing income every month.  What\'s more - we will\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\n\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\ncan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send\nan email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.\n\nHow much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\nand rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\njust the thing you are looking for.\n\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,\nthere are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\neach month also).\n\nInterested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\ndecide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still\nhave that "burning desire" to find an opportunity that will reward\nthem incredibly well, if they work at it.\n\nTo grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the \n web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following \n informtion\n\n"Send me a free membership!"\n\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\n\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\nas soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.\n\nIf you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)\nyou are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,\nVery Cheap ISP package and many many more,\n\nYou can also go to the web address:\nhttp://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService\n\nThat\'s all there\'s to it.\n\nWe\'ll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nSincerely, \n\nHugh Zou\n\nP.S.

'\n\nHi -\n\n( http://club.4tfox.com )\n\nYou get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.\nMost of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.\nAnd they expect you to listen to them?\n\nEnough.\n\nIf you want to make money with your computer, then you should\nhook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making\na large, continuing income every month.  What\'s more - we will\nshow YOU how to do the same thing.\n\nThis business is done completely by internet and email, and you\ncan even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send\nan email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.\n\nHow much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.\nWe are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.\nBut keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to \ninsult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,\nand rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if\nyou are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be\njust the thing you are looking for.\n\nThis is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is\ndone FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,\nthere are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -\nmeaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase\neach month also).\n\nInterested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a\nfree member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you\ndecide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still\nhave that "burning desire" to find an opportunity that will reward\nthem incredibly well, if they work at it.\n\nTo grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the \n web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following \n information\n\n"Send me a free membership!"\n\nBe sure to include your:\n1. First name\n2. Last name\n3. Email address (if different from above)\n\nWe will confirm your position and send you a special report\nas soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.\n\nIf you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)\nyou are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,\nVery Cheap ISP package and many many more,\n\nYou can also go to the web address:\nhttp://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService\n\nThat\'s all there\'s to it.\n\nWe\'ll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nSincerely, \n\nHugh Zou\n\nP.S. After having several negative experiences with network\nmarketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.\nThis is different - there is value, integrity, and a\nREAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...\nand finally make real money on the internet.\n\nDon\'t pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the\nprogram for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free\nmembership.\n\nUnsubscribing: Send a blank email to: removemefromlist@bigfoot.com with\n"Remove" in the subject line.

"\n\nMr.Vincent Nnaji,\n Standard Trust Bank Ltd,\n Lagos,Nigeria.\n Dear Sir,\n I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. \nOn January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.\nUpon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. \nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \nAccording to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.\n I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \nThis is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. \nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction.

"\n\nDear Sir, \nWith due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you\nwould\nbe of great assistance to my children and I.\nI got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed\nthat\nyou must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to\nintimidate me\nor betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the\nKEREMA\nlocal district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.\nMUNDI A.\nKOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul\nKoromah\nbecause he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining\nCorporation\nof Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he \ninstructed me\nand my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,\nbefore the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)\nforces\nintervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children\nand I\nmanaged to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came\ninto\nTogo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE\nMILLION\nUNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited\nwith a\nTrust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the\ncurrier\ncompany who will freight the money to your country.\nMeanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in\nyour\ncountry because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the\nfuture of\nmy children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the\nTrust\nCompany in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be\ndeposited\ninto your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to\nsource for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your\ncountry when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.\nWe have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have\nresolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I\nam being\nmonitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice\nyou to\nhave the \ndeal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this\nemail:\nibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us\nproceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring\nsame into\nyour account.\nYour private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private\ndiscussions. \nNote: There is no risk involved in this business. \nRemain Blessed, \nMRS. ANNE  KOJO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

"\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am well confident of your capability to assist me in\na transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie\n(me and you) I am also believing that you will not\nexpose or betray the trust and confidence I am about\nto establish with you. I have decided to contact you\nwith greatest delight and personal respect.\n\nWell, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY\nSANKOH\nwho was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE\nmonths ago in my country Sierra Leone.\nFew days before the arrest of my father, he confided\nin me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and\nmove out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and\nCash Receipt he made with a security Company in\nAbidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box\ncontaining USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two\nMillion dollars).\n\nThis money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond\nby my FATHER and he have already\ndecided to use this money for future investment of\nthe family before his arrest.\n\nThereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these\ndocuments and confirmed the deposit of the box by my\nfather. Also, I have been granted political stay as a\nRefugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nMeanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a\ntrusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this\nmoney from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .\nBased on this , I solicit for your assistance to\ntransfer this fund into your Account, but I will\ndemand for the following requirement:\n\n(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where\nthis fund will be transferred to in your country or\nanother neaarby country where taxation will not\ntakegreat toll on the money?\n\n(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my\ntravelling papers after this transfer to enable me\ncome over to meet you in your country for\ntheinvestment of this money?\n\n(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable\nbusiness venture that would not require much technical\nexpertise in your country where part of this fund\nwillbe invested?\n\nPlease, all these requirements are urgently needed as\nit will enable me to establish a stronger business\nrelationship with you hence I will like you to be the\ngeneral overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a\nChristian and I will please, want you to handle this\ntransaction based on the trust I have established\non you.\n\nFor your assistance in this transaction, I have\ndecided to offer you 12% percent commission of the\ntotal amount at the end of this business. The security\nof this business is very important to me and as such,\nI would like you to keep this business very\nconfidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.\nThank you and God bless you.\n\nVICTOR SANKOH\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

(Product descriptions, pricing and deep-discounted Intro Offers information below.)\n\nSEVENTH HEAVEN "SWEET TREAT" MENU \n\n1. SHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE (tm) (Gnarly Sweet Grass).  Absolutely, the most significant legal "Personal Choice" non-cannabis, non-marijuana, non-tobacco smoking botanical on the planet.\n\n2.

CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm) A sedate smoking and/or brewing Happiness  Botanical. \n\n********************************\n**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**\n********************************\n\n"Personal Choice" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly "SweetGrass" Variety / Supplemental Agenda "Seventh Heaven" Paradoxical Configuration for the "significant" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit "sensitivities" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood "Sensitive / Responsive" Smoking / Brewing Herba.\n\nActions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; "Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)\n\nThis is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking ("Smoka") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!\n\nWe have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater "Sensitivity / Responsiveness" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature "smokables" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This "Shangrila" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!\n must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves "potent significance" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after "flowering" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all "viripotent," which makes this "gnarly stoke" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve "viripotency" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!\ng time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.\n\nSuffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, "sensitive/responsive", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking ("Smoka") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!\n\n* Mill-stoned & honed.\n* Depressive regressive!\n* Psychologically uplifting!\n* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!\n* Sophisticated, well-balanced "ambiance."\n* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.\n* "Potentiated" & viripotent!\n* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.\n* Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring)\n* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!\n* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.\n* Easy on, easy off!\n* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!\n* No "munchie" factor.\n* No failed drug tests!\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly "SweetGrass" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent "Smoka", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist\'s way, four or five draws of "Smoka" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent "Sensitive / Responsive" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) "Sensitive/Responsive" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit.\n\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age.  All things in their time.... \n\n********************************************************\nSHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE PRICING:\n\n* One 1 oz. bag (incl. herb-pipe only) $80.00 (plus shipping)\n* One 4 oz.

Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!\nally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.\n\nProsaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. \n\nSuggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) \n\nAlso Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician\'s care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.\n\n********************************************************\nPROSAKA PRICING:\n\n* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping\n* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping\nFor larger quantities, please inquire.\n\n(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings!)\n\n*******************************************\n**AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops)**\n*******************************************\n\n"Personal Choice" enhanced "Sensitivity" for non-smokers & tokers.\n\nAqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while.
