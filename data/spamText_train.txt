"\n\nDEAR FRIEND,I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU\nSESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nOF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,\nTHIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENTCIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.\nI ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS\nGEORGE  KONGOLO  AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF\nCONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY\nAND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN\nMORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER\nDISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO\nCHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\nDEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER\nFORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW\nHEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE\nARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER\nEUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nTREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE\nMY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO\nSTUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,\nLIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON\nTAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S\nCHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE\nFRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY\nIDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND\nCONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION\nUNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A\nSECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE\nSECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM\nKNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO\nINDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR\nBEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON\n(KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I\nWANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY\nREVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL\nCOMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND\nNON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT\nEMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH\nTHIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY\nTHE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN\nCONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL\nPUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU\nWHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND\nALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATIONFOR YOUR SERVICES.\nFOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT\nINFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX\nNUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE.BEST REGARDS,MRS M. SESE SEKO\n\n\n\n"

money.\xa0 When I received this program I grumbled<BR>to \nJody about receiving "junk mail".\xa0 I made fun of the<BR>whole thing, \nspouting my knowledge of the population and<BR>percentages involved.\xa0 I \n"knew" it wouldn\'t work.\xa0 Jody<BR>totally ignored my supposed intelligence \nand a few days later<BR>she jumped in with both feet.\xa0 I made merciless fun \nof her,<BR>and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when<BR>the thing \ndidn\'t work.\xa0 Well, the laugh was on me!\xa0 Within<BR>3 weeks she had \nreceived 50 responses.\xa0 Within the next 45<BR>days she had received a total \nof $147,200.00 all cash!<BR>I was shocked.\xa0 I have joined Jody in her \n"hobby".<BR><BR>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Mitchell Wof,\xa0 Chicago, \nIllinois<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took me several weeks to<BR>make up my mind to \nparticipate in this plan.\xa0 But conservative<BR>that I am, I decided that \nthe initial investment was so little<BR>that there was just no way that I \nwouldn\'t get enough orders<BR>to at least get my money back.\xa0 I was \nsurprised when I found<BR>my medium sized post office box crammed with \norders.\xa0 I made<BR>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.\xa0 The nice thing \nabout this<BR>deal is that it does not matter where people live.\xa0 \nThere<BR>simply isn\'t a better investment with a faster return and<BR>so \nbig".<BR><BR>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Dan Sondstrom,\xa0 Alberta, \nCanada<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"I \nhad received this program before.\xa0 I deleted it, but later<BR>I wondered if \nI should hav given it a try.\xa0 Of course, I<BR>had no idea who to contact to \nget another copy, so I had to<BR>wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else \n. . . . . . . <BR>11 months passed then it luckily came again.\xa0 I did not \n<BR>delete this one!\xa0 I made more than $490,000 on my first try<BR>and all \nthe money came within 22 weeks".<BR><BR>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Susan De \nSuza,\xa0\xa0 New York, \nNY<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>"It \nreally is a great opportunity to make relatively easy<BR>money with little cost \nto you.\xa0 I followed the simple<BR>instructions carefully and within 10 days \nthe money started<BR>to come in.\xa0 My first month I made $20,560.00 and by \nthe<BR>end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.<BR>Life is \nbeautiful, thanks to the Internet".<BR><BR>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Fred \nDellaca,\xa0 Westport, New

"\n\nOWOLABI & ASSOCIATE,\nFALOMO, IKOYI.\nLAGOS - NIGERIA.\n\n\nYOUR KIND ATTN.,\n\n\n\nRE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.\n\nI humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this\nmail, if the contents does not meet with your personal\nand business ethics, I apologize in advance.\n\nI am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I\nrepresent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief\nsecurity advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the\nperson of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the\nadvent of a new democratic\ndispensation in the country under the leadership of\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under\nsevere persecution due to the sensitive position he\nheld in the last military regime, presently he is\nunder house arrest restricted only to the confines of\nhis village.\n\nThe main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a\nbusiness proposal that might be of interest to you. My\nclient has informed me of the existence of funds\ndeposited with a security company abroad. This fund\ncame about as part of security votes that were\nallocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure\nas chief security adviser to the then president. What\nhappened was that he had part of the funds transferred\nfrom the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this\nsecurity outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal\nsecurity outfit of the\nthen president. But before the purchase could take\nplace the president died. My client has decided to\nkeep this for himself as all his properties has been\nconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his\nincarceration he cannot travel out and effect the\nchange of possession to his benefit.\n\nI have been mandated by my client to source for a\nforeign partner that can help him facilitate the\nchange of possession. The deposit certificate and the\ncode needed for the execution of this endeavor are in\nmy possession.\n\nThe funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand\nUnited States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.\n\nI remain most obliged.\n\nBarrister Kola Owolabi(JP).\nPrincipal Partner.

'\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract\naward and review committee set up by the federal\ngovernment of Nigeria under the new civilian\ndispensation to award new contracts and review\nexisting ones.\nI came to know of you in my search for a reliable and\nreputable person to handle a very confidential\ntransaction, which involves the transfer of a huge\nsum of money to a foreign account. \n\nThere were series of contracts executed by a \nconsortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in\nfavor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these \ncontracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum\nof US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand \nUnited\nState Dollars). This amount has now been approved and\nis now ready to be transferred being that the\ncompanies\nthat actually executed these contracts have been\nfully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. \n\n\nConsequently, my colleagues and I are willing to \ntransfer the total amount to your account for\nsubsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants\nare prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil\nservice law) from operating and/or opening foreign \naccounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in \nreturn, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the \ntransferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for\nincidental expenses (internal and external) between\nboth parties in the course of the transaction you will\nbe mandated to remit the balance to other accounts\nin due course. \n\nModalities have been worked out at the highest level\nof the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of \nNigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds\nwithin 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of\nthe above stated terms. \nOur assurance is that your role is risk free. To \n\naccord this transaction the legality it deserves and\nfor mutual security of the funds the whole approval\nprocedures will officially and legally processed\nwith your name or the name of any company you may\nnominate as the bonefide beneficiary. \nOnce more I want you to understand that having put\nin over twenty-five years in the civil service of my\ncountry, I am averse to having my image and career \ndented. This matter should therefore be treated with\nutmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. \n\nPlease you should signify your intention to assist\nby sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this\ntransaction, if favorable we will take further steps\nto brief you the full details of this viable \ntransaction. \nI want to assure you that this business proposal is\n100% risk free as we have done our homework\nproperly. \n\nI quite believe that you will protect our interest\nby taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are\nstill in government service, which we intend to\nretire from in full honor.\n\nKindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to\nenable us include this transfer in the next batch\nwhich would constitute the new quarter payments\nfor the 2002 financial year. \n\nThank you and God bless.\n\nDr James Alabi\n\n\n\n\n\n'

You will learn new\nskills in communications and how to market on the internet.\nWhat a Deal!  Your total cash investment is just $50.00.\n\nStep 1.  If this is the first time you have seen this message,\nand you have not joined in this program before, then\ntake out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail\nout $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five\nGuides on communications.  For each Guide that you will\nbe ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white\npaper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAIL\nADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide that\nyou are buying.  Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill\ninside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill\ninto an envelope, address the envelope with the name and\naddress of the person whose name is shown under each\nGuide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air\nmail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the\nenvelopes.  No need to send by registered mail.\n\nLIST OF FIVE NAMES****************************\n________________________________________________\n\nGUIDE# 1: "How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"\nOrder Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition to\nGuide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide\n"A Million Bucks From the Internet", free of charge)\n\nDerrick Nguyen\t\n9530 Whitmore St\t\nEl Monte, CA 91733\t\nUSA\n________________________________________________\n\nGUIDE # 2: "How to Give a Business Presentation"\nOrder Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from:\n\nTim Fai\nGPO Box 260\nMacau (via Hong Kong)\n________________________________________________\n\nGUIDE# 3: "How to Write More Effectively"\nOrder Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from:\n\nLuis Pastor\nApartado 81\n48080 Bilbao\nSpain\n________________________________________________\n\nGUIDE # 4: "What to do at a Social Function"\nOrder Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from:\n\nChester Waldvogel\n11 Chestnut Way\nBerlin, MD 21811\nUSA\n________________________________________________\n\nGUIDE # 5: "How To Sharpen Your Mind"\nOrder Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from:\n\nJ. Siden\nKrondikesvagen 54 A\n83147 Ostersund\nSweden\n________________________________________________\nEND OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************\n\nStep 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these\nGuides on your computer\'s hard disk as other people will be\nordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and\nyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.\n\nStep 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and\naddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that\nslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4\'s\nslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.\nCheck the address again.\n\nStep 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3\'s slot.\n\nStep 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and\nreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2\'s slot.\n\nStep 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1\'s slot.\n\nStep 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and\nreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This\nstep is how your own name and address is entered into the\nlist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,\nyour own name will go down the list of names until you have\nreached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The\nkey point is that the number of people ordering Guides from\nyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.\n\nStep 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out\nthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to\nas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000\nemails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings\nyou make, potentially the greater the number of people who\nwill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then\nmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the email\nshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.\n\nThis is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of\nthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps\nshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as\nmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help\nthose who purchase the Guides from you to send out\nemails of their own.\n\nDo NOT change anything other than what is instructed.\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate\nreaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list\nwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.\nThat might seem to you like a clever move because new\nbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  But\nthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.\nWhat will benefit you most is having people who will send\nout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new\nbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren\'t going to\nbe sending new emails, you\'re only hurting yourself by\neffectively closing down the program with your name on\ntop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There\nwouldn\'t be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver\nwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done\nthe work, and your name has worked its way to further\ndown the list, by then you deserve the rewards and\nearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for\nanyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don\'t\ndo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!\n\nYou may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to\nthe five people on the list that one of the people will just\ntake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest\nassured.  As we said above, it\'s to our benefit to have you\nas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find\nnew buyers.  So don\'t think the people on the list will try to\ncheat you or to "stiff" you for $10.00.  The people on the list\nwould rather have you working hard because your effort will\nbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send\nyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal\nby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don\'t cheat.\nProvide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.\n******END OF SUMMARY************************\n\n=======REST OF MESSAGE======================\n\nWith easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in\nthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary\npeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.\nAnd the earnings potential is staggering!\n\nREAD THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a\nRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can\nafford to buy that new car or home that you have been\nlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never\nresponded to one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething made me feel: "You use $50 going to a movie\nfor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple\nmeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?"  No matter where\nyou believe those "feelings" came from, I thank every day\nthat feeling came over me.\n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing\nhad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,\nYou’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.\nWhat can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and\nconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recover\nyour investment and make some good money: making over\nhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.\nIf you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct\nmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing\nvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done\nin the future, then the experience you will gain here could\nbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing\na new career for you.\n\n= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =\n\nIf you want to make serious money, read this message until\nyou understand it completely and feel confident to follow\nthrough on what it advises.\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!\n\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,\nit will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You\nare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such\nand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period\nof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and\nthe others on the list of five.\n\n===========================================\n*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,\nand save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\nCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\n===========================================\n\nLet\'s say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that\nyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.\nLet\'s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%\n(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better\nbut let\'s just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will\nsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nOut of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only\n5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also\nsend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of\nthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.\nThat\'s 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.\n\nThose 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders\nfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each\nfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response\nis 625 orders for Guide # 4.\n\nThose 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total\nof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125\norders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This\nmay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a\nvery low response rate with a small number of emails being\nsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate\nup just slightly.\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795\n\nIf Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\n$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100\n\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\nemails each or more?  From the example above, you can see\nthe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the\namount of money from a small increase in the response rate.\n\nThere are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide\nand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.\n\nMETHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n===========================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are\nMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on\nthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start\nwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.\nFor every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the\nGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.\n\nThe people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise\nyou how to get the large number of email addresses that\nyou need to send the new email containing your name and\naddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,\nyou also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to\ntheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because your\nname would be further down the list, and their new buyers\nwill buy from you.  This is no different than "customer\nservice" in the retail or the  "bricks and mortars" business.\n\n===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============\nThe reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or\nsomehow  "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks\nor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it\nis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope\nand steal it before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nAlways send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each\nGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden\nby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of\nthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME\nof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS\nand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the\nenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to\nmail the envelope.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW\nFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL\n________________________________________________\nYOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1\nwithin 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.\n\n=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,\nyou should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If\nnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.\n\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,\nYOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and\ncash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT\nTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice\nand instruction on how to send out more emails. You can\nKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people\nare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.\nThere is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!\n===========================================\nA NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\nYou have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don\'t\nwish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You\ncan make more money in the next few weeks and months\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.\n\nRemember to email the revised copy of this email after you\nhave put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved\nothers to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the\npeople you send this to may send out 100,000 or more\nemails and your name will be on every one of them.\nRemember, the more you send out the more potential\nbuyers you will reach.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND\nEMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!\n\nUpon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the\nCopyright owner assigns to you two important rights:\n(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the\nGUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign\nto your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer\nto resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1\nis a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It\'s\nfree of charge and will give you the tools you need.\n\nThe right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES\nis reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to\nresell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the\ninternet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.\nYOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR\nDISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the\nGuides for your own personal use to enhance your\ncommunication skills.\n\n===========================================\n\n* This message is not intended for residents of localities that\nhave legal ordinances prohibiting engaging in such programs.\nScreening of addresses has been done to the best of our ability.\n\nThis message is only being sent once to recipients and thus\nis no need to remove your email address from our mailing\nlist.  You will not be receiving further emails with this message.\n\niangxsifpkvgobwlxwhvvxfs\n\n'

'\n\nINVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. \n\nResearch Alert - Undervalued\nAugust 26, 2002\nXrayMedia\n(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8\n\nCongratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! \n\nPick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.\n\nPick #2 - ENBC Began its\' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... \n\nOur Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company\'s direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its’ technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, we’ve never seen anything like it!\n\nHow does the company do this? \n\nXrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a "mass source to advertising sector " live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the company’s’ strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users’ criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. \n\nTheir "source to business model", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.\n\nWhile investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.\n\n *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.\n\n*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. \n\n*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.\n\n*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.\n\n*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. \n\n*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings "substantially" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.\n \nShares Outstanding:      \t83 mm\nFloat:                         \t5  mm\nRecent Price:               \t$00.08\nYear Low/High:            \t$00.02 - $00.19\n18-Month Target Price:  \t$5.00+\n\nCompany Contact: Ray Dabney \nToll free:  1(888) 777-0658     \n\n(h3)6926Zjpl7\n\n\n'

'\n\n \n                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  \n\nPlus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.\n\nMany are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  \n\n                          *** 801-397-9010 *** \n\nPlease do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.

We want a reliable \nperson who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five\nHundred Thousand United States Dollars ( \n$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World\nCountries.\n\nThis fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us\nunder the budget allocation to our Ministry. This \nbill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The\ncontract has since been executed, \ncommissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.\nWe are left with the balance US$20.5M as part \nof the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for\nour own use. But under our protocol division, we \nas civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This\nis why we are soliciting your assistance in this \nmanner and regard .\n\nAs you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address\nfrom adverts in the business directory . I am the \nChief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )\nof the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \n( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and\nTROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. \nOfficials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this\nMinistry. We have been exercising patience for this \nopportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity\nwe cannot afford to miss.\n\nWe have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of\nus and I and one of my colleagues \ninvolved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,\nupon the confirmation from you that the Certified \nInternational Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.\n\nConsequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your\ninterest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel \nNo: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and\nCity(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert \nTelephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax\nyou or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS \nTRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get\nthrough.\nNOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please\ninform us so that we can look for another reliable \nperson who can assist in this respect. \n\nIt might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this\ntransaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be \ndiscovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual\ntrust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this \ntransaction.

'\n\nI am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran\nch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\n\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email: \n\nThanks and regards. \n\nMR.IKE EJOH\n\n\n'

Please see the bottom of this\nmessage for further information and removal instructions.\n\n\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN\nHIS CLOSET!\n\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\n\n"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old\nwoman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that\'s more than my\nhusband earns in a year".\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \n"Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever\n15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\nthe top of the list.\n\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\nname at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the time, and\nreally did not think it was going to work", the boy continues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\n\n"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all".  Over\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."  The\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\ncloset, barely had time for my homework".He had also been riding his bike\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \nfifties and hundreds.\n\n"I didn\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\nbank down the street (laughs)."  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news \n\nteam examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\n\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\n"Please send me report number XYX".This simple note made the letter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What \nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you\nsay "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\n"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost".\n\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\nTHAN EVER.\n\n\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.\n\nIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.\n\nThis is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".\n\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nHere is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time \nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\nanything." More testimonials later but first,\n\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\n\n++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE \nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE\nSURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT\n CORNER in case of any mail problems.\n\n When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from\nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be\naccessible for you to send to the 1,000\'s of people who will order them from\nyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\nsomething happens to your computer.\n\n\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next\nto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is\ninstructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose out on majority of\nyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see\nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.\nBut it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy\nand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than\nwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,\nhonesty reaps the reward!!!\n\n\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and\nREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.\n3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4.\n4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3.\n5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\n\n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on\nyour computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\n\n\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nLet\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let\'s\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\n\n\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders for Report #5. THAT\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\n\n=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\nthe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\n\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nREPORT #1: The Insider\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\n\nOrder Report #1 from:\nR.

One of the people you send this to may send out\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customers\nyou will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, \nmaterials and opportunity to become financially independent. \nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW!\n\n++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++\n"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n"junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\npopulation and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn\'t work. Jody\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n"I told you so" on her when the thing didn\'t work. Well, the laugh was on\nme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45\ndays she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.\nI have joined Jody in her "hobby".\n\nMitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\nwouldn\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back". "I was\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn\'t a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big".\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\nelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete\nthis one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money\ncame within 22 weeks".\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this program, contact the Office\nof Associate Director for Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington,D.C.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis email was sent to you via Saf-E Mail Systems.

The pursuit of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. \nThe fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. \nThe companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. \n\nHERE\'S GOOD NEWS \n\nThere IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven\'t yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you\'ve dreamed about is easier than you think! \n\nWith your permission, I\'d like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn\'t work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you\'ll wonder why you haven\'t heard of this before. \n\nI promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. \n\nTo receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type "Send Info" in the Subject box and hit Send. I\'ll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. \n\nCordially, \n\nMark R Sherman \n\nP.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you\'ve read it. And it\'s FREE! \n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n'

'\n\nTHE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME \nTHE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! \nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV \nAs seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. \nI hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren\'t interested, just \nsimply delete it. \nREAD THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy \nweekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. \nBelieve it, work it. \nThis really works, don\'t make the same mistake I made. I deleted this \n4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders \n(money) \nstarted coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a \ntry!! \nYou will be glad you did. \nThanks and Good Luck! You won\'t need luck, just keep reading. Don\'t \ndelete this!!! \n------------------------------------------------------ \nFirst read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... \nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. \nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN \nIN HIS CLOSET! \nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. \nYou most likely have just seen this story recently \nfeatured on a major nightly news program (USA). \nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning \nand putting laundry away when she came across a large \nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath \nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her \n15-year-old sons closet. \nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got \nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. \nFive-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - \nall neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. \n"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", \nsays the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 \ndollars in that bag -- that\'s more than my husband \nearns in a year". \nThe woman immediately called her husband at the \ncar-dealership where he worked to tell him what she \nhad discovered. He came home right away and they \ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up. \nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from \nwas more shocking than actually finding it in \nthe closet. \nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via \nE-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he \nobtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for \nthe past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his \ncomputer in his bedroom. \n"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the \nheck, I put my name on it like the instructions said \nand I started sending it out", says the clever \n15-year-old. \nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained \ninstructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person \non the list, then delete the address at the top and \nmove the others addresses down, and finally to add \nyour name to the top of the list. \nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive \nseveral thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 \nweeks if you sent out the letter with your \nname at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk \nE-mail all the time, and really did not think it was \ngoing to work", the boy continues. \nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, \nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him \nfor his video-game magazine subscriptions began to \nfill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing \n$5 bills. \n"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post \noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 \nenvelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip \nthat said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. \nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He \ngoes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a \nwhole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back \nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not \ncarry it all". \nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending \nout the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I \njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, \nbarely had time for my homework". He had also \nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his \narea and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties \nand hundreds. \n"I didn\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept \nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a \ntime in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at \nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to \nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. \nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and \ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and \nmy dad would have to come in and do it, but I just \nrode to the next bank down the street (laughs)." \nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be \nafraid. The reporting news team examined and \ninvestigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was \nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter \nat all. In fact, it was completely legal according to \nUS Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and \n1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also \nin the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, \nSections 255 and 436, which state a product or service \nmust be exchanged for money received. \nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a \nlittle note that read, "Please send me report number \nXYX".This simple note made the letter legal because he \nwas exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \nfive-dollar fee. \n[This is the end of the media release.

This is the \nletter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the \npopularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news \nprogram \nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program \ndescribed below, to see if it really can make people money. The show \nalso \ninvestigated whether or not the program was legal. \nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are \'\'absolutely NO \nLaws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow \nthe simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \n$25 out of pocket cost\'\'. \nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS \nPROGRAM HAS \nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \nThis is what one had to say: \'\' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. \nI was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so \nglad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for \nthe minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received \ntotal \n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\'\'. \nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \n=========================================================\n=======Here is \nanother testimonial: \'\'\' this program has been around for a \nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this \nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the \nsimple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to \ncome \nin. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that \nmade a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering \nthe \nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \nanything.\'\' More testimonials later but first: \n===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$ \nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily \nand comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and \nAGAIN!!! \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n$$$$$$$$ \nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL \nDREAMS WILL COME \nTRUE, GUARANTEED! \nINSTRUCTIONS: \n================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \n================= \nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT \nYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose \nname appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.

To assist \nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you \npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which \nincludes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of \nfree \nclassified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this \nventure going: \nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n=========================================================\n======= \nLet\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. \nLet\'s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the \nresponse \ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many \npeople will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 \neach).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. \nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 \nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total \nof 50,000. \nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That\'s=100 \npeople responded and ordered Report # 2. \nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 \ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 \nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders \nfor Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a \ntotal of \n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 \norders for \nReport # 5 THAT\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \nmillion). \nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \n+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand \nTotal=$555,550.00 \nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE \nWORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL \nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! \n=========================================================\n======= \nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING \nOUT \nOF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if \neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails \neach or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide \nand counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! \nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n=========================================================\n======= \nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are \nhundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the \nInternet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you \nstart with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you \nreceive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That\'s \nit. Always provide \nsame day service on all orders. \nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your \nname and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise \nuntil they receive the report. \n===================AVAILABLE REPORTS \n========================== \nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always \nsend \n$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure \nthe cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On \none of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you \nare ordering, \nYOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. \nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \n=========================================================\n======= \nREPORT #1 "The Insider\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net" \nOrder Report #1 from: \nK.Palludan \n9550 Summersweet Ct. \nLas Vegas, Nevada 89123 \nUSA \n________________________________________________________________\n______ \nREPORT #2 "\'The insider\'s Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net\' \nOrder Report #2 from: \nKris Estes \n3055 Casey Drive #203 \nLas Vegas, Nevada 89120 \n________________________________________________________________\n______ \nREPORT #3 "\'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net" \nOrder Report #3 from : \nP.

Lasley \n4230 Edgewood Circle \nIdaho Falls, Idaho 83406 \nUSA \n________________________________________________________________\n_____ \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success: \n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 \nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. \n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you \nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue \nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do. \n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN \nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will \ncontinue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your \nname \nis moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. \nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \npeople are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME \nSEND \nANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS \nAGAIN.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! \n====================== MORE \nTESTIMONIALS====================== \n\'\' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \n\'\'junk mail\'\'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of \nthe population and percentages involved. I \'\'knew\'\' it wouldn\'t work. Jody \ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in \nwith \nboth feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \n\'\'I told you so\'\' on her when the thing didn\'t work. Well, the laugh was \non me! \nWithin 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she \nhad \nreceived total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have \njoined \nJody in her \'\'hobby\'\'. \nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois \n=========================================================\n======= \'\' Not \nbeing the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my \nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided \nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that \nI \nwouldn\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back\'\'. \'\' I was \nsurprised \nwhen I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made \n$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is \nthat it does not matter where people live. There simply isn\'t a better \ninvestment \nwith a faster return and so big\'\'. \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n=========================================================\n======= \'\' I had \nreceived this program before. I deleted it, but later I \nwondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who \nto contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed \nagain by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came \nagain.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my \nfirst try and all the money came within 22 weeks\'\'. \nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \n=========================================================\n====== \n\'\' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and \nwithin 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made \n$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ \n362,840.00.

I was, until recently, a final  year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa.  Early in January last year, the rebels\nin my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target.\n\nFortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took  place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d\'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d\'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next\nof kin to my father.\n\nBut deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it  to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a\ntime that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping\nme to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing.\nPlease you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nKEVIN GEORGE                                                                          \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!

"\n\nATTN:\n\nI am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. \n\nSTEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail\nWill surprise you, though we do not know, \nDue to the current war against white farmers in\nZimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to\nClaim all white owned farms in our country to gain\nFavor for re-election.\n\nAll white farmers were asked to\nSurrender their farms to the government for\nRe-distribution and infact to his political party\nMembers and my father though black was the treasury\nof the farmers association and a strong member of an\nOpposition party that did not support the president\nIdea. He then ordered his party members and the police\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will \nDocuments has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit\nKept in custody for us in a security company unknown\nTo the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as \nPersonal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could\nEasily be found by his enemies. The total amount is\nUS$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for\nYour assistance to help us move the fund out of\nZimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from\nreality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of\nInternational Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the \nFinance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer\nClearance above US$1M is just a few of the\nUnthinkable things he is committing in my Country.\nI have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.\nJohn Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was\nLeaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family\nLate last year following this ugly development to no\nAvail.\nShould you be interested to help us, contact me\nImmediately via email for easy communication and I\nWill furnish you with the time frame and modalities of\nthe transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of \nCaring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that \nThis transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will \nNot endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%\nOf the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any\nAccount of your choice were the incident of taxation\nwill not take much tool on the money and we look\nForward to coming over to your country to invest our\nShare and settle there. I will a private\nPhone so that our conversation can be\n100% confidential.\n\nNOTE: DO REPLY TO bulmulete@golfemail.com\n\n\nGod bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.\n\nMr. BULAWA  MULETE JR\n \n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"

'\n\nDear sir,,\n\n\nMy name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo\nDuba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South\nAfrican Information exchange Johannesburg.\n.\n\nDue to the previous war against white farmers in\nZimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters\nto claim all the white owned farms in our country, he\nordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all\ntheir farms to his party members and his followers. My\nfather was a victim of this oppression and inhuman\nbehavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our\ncountry,my fayher was totaly against the act by the\npresidnt MUGABE. The president’s supporters invaded my\nfather’s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested\nhim and confiscated all his investment.\n\nEarly last year when this victimization of white\nfarmers by president Mugabe started, my late father\nenvisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all\nhis money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of\nZimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.\nWhen he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a\nprivate security company through the help of his\nlawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real\ncontents of the box to the security company, then,\nwent back home. He registered the box as family\ntreasure.\n\nWhile he was still in detention that led to his death\ndue to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South\nAfrica because of the escalation of the crisis in\nZimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He\nwas arrested on the 5th of March last year.\nUnfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of\nDecember 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002.\n\nNow my stay here in Africa is frustrating and\ndepressing because my father’s lawyer is presently\nhospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem;\nthough the lodgment documents are with me, as such I\nwant to relocate to your country for good. Presently,\nmy residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum\npermit as a refugee.\n\nI am seeking for your assistance in transferring the\nmoney in the security company (US$15 Million) out of\nthis country to your country for investment. If you\nthink you can help me, Please try to get in touch with\nme immediately with the  number below . Your\ncompensation/share for assistance will be negotiated\nif you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my\ncountry is still lingering, please endeavor to keep\nthis information to yourself and secret, because I\nwouldn’t want anything that will expose me, and the\nexistence of this money.\n\nYour urgent response will be highly appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSTEVEN DUBA (DR).\n\nTEL:27-83-713-2696\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

"\n\nDear friend,\n\nI am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. \n\nThis was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. \n\nHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation\ntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over\n(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State\nDollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim\nof the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and\nstock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of\nconfidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and\nconfidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where\nthe funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.\n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: \n"DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation." \n"A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed." http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) \nThe purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) \nCorrection: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 \nmiles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, ...** \n(Comment: Just because the RMI government "...has condemned the \'fraudulent assertions\' ...of ...EnenKio...", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) \n**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** \n(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don\'t even know what being a "sister nation" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and \nthe same could be said for DOM. \n**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, "...an article in Agence France-Presse" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an "...investment scam...". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \n**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** \n(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no "fraudulent claims" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any "..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..." nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early 1990s.** \n(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) \nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the \nowner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** \nCorrection: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made \npossible by Murjel\'s appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios\' and the people\'s behalf. \n**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an "agreement"? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \'Marshallese\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in \'cyberspace\') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE \nJune 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling \'EnenKio\' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. \n"Fantasy Island" -- "Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: "Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio," another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands." \nhttp://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: "Fantasy Island", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the "Melchizedek press release" you cited, indicating that "...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio,...". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. \nThe Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore\'s rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is "...another only-in- cyberspace country...", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \'Marshallese\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not \'cyberspace\') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE \nJune 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). "Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai\'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island\'s independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek." Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with "**") in color: \n**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** \nCorrection: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the \nnorthernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: "Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory." **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan\'s historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. \nThe Author responds: "I don\'t see much conflict between the two versions here." \n**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: "I will note this." **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai\'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai\'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho\'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island\'s independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. \nThe Author responds: "I will make the necessary corrections here." **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** \nCorrection: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios \nsucceeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. \nThe Author responds: "I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore\'s Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so." (June 7, 1999) \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE\nJune 1, 1999: News Release\nPart One Background: \nOn May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a "press release" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, "Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said "press release" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called "Press Release": \nThis unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. \nThe RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). \nÂ» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, \nIroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. \nÂ» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution \nof the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.

Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political \njurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nMr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: \nÂ» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo \nConvention (1933). \nÂ» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, \nwhich included the United States, China and the USSR.

On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more "remote" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice." [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. \nThe unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. \nFurthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic cleansing" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

Â\xa0 His Majesty King Remios Hermios \nSecond Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â\xa0 His \nMajesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE \nMarch 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A "State of War" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â\xa0 The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in "taking possession" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â\xa0 The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.Â\xa0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â\xa0 Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the "\'State of War\', a Declaration" and broadcast it to the world.Â\xa0 The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.Â\xa0 It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â\xa0 While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.Â\xa0 The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.Â\xa0 Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.Â\xa0 The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. \nWhile the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â\xa0 The refusal of \nthe U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â\xa0 Your understanding is appreciated.Â\xa0 \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE\nDecember 19, 1998: News Release \nSubject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio \nThe government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE \nJuly 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against "fraudulent claims". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual "state of war" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. \nThe Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) "asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..." of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People\'s venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d\'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to \nthe Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org \nReferencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled "Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand," of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom\'s web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. \nThe published statement, "The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not "created" by Robert Moore and he is not a "Honolulu-based attorney." HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. "Enenkio" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. "Wake" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE\nMay 4, 1997: News Release \nSubject: Issuance of Gold Stamps \nThe government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official "First Day of Issue" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. \nBACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in "exile". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. \nA NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to "Wake" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. \n"STATE OF WAR" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual "state of war" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. \nCLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the "state of war" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. \nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE\nMarch 31, 1997: News Release \nAn official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: "A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES." This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. \nThis latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. \nThe land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by "Western explorers" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. \nHowever, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its "ownership" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the "natives" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more "hospitable" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho\'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. \nUpon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, "yields to the recognition that a State of War" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. "ownership" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: Â» Â» "...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable \naccord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...". Â» Â» "If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens." \nÂ» Â» "...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and\nevery \naction of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..." \nÂ» Â» "...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior Â» Â» "...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay." Â» Â» That the "...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...". \nThe government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE \xa0TOP OF PAGE \nFebruary 6, 1995: News Release \nOn behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year\'s Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; \n2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the "star wars" program, I am led to believe. \nAn emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army\'s so-called "no significant impact" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. \nOn March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. \nDocuments and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. \nRequest for Media Response: \nThe thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of "world leadership"? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: \n1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) \n2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was "decommissioned" after the so-called "processing" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). \n3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. \n4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king\'s claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. \n5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) \n6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho\'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) \nParting Shot: \nWhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western "civilized" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of "manifest destiny" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at "fixing up the world". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. \nTOP OF PAGE\nNovember 21, 1994: News Release \nIn a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. \nThe legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios\' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. \nWhile putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. \nEneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King\'s behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King\'s assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: "Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island" and stated: "Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. \nSince 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was "decommissioned" more than a decade ago. \nÂ» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed \nTheater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese "natural" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. \nStill mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone \nRobert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission \nDO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands \nhttp://www.enenkio.org \n\n\n'

'\n\nIt was the Spring of 1979.  \n\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\n\nStealing other kids\' lunch money.\n\nNo, I didn\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\nthem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,\n"and I\'ll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \nwhen "next week" rolled around and I couldn\'t pony up the cash,\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \nlonger.\n\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \nthings on their mind than last year\'s lunch money.\n\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\nand I didn\'t even get beat up.\n\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \nsecrets you will ever learn.\n\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\'re not\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\nyou\'re ahead.  Don\'t wait for the boat to sink before \ngrabbing the lifejacket.\n\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\n\nThe "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\nyour money in the market, the more money you\'re going to make.\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\n"NEVER".  \n\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\nfund right now, you\'ll probably have over a million dollars\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\'s the problem:\n\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\n\nHell no!\n\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\'s hard to\nmake use of your fortune when you\'re seventy years old \nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \n\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\n\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\'t\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\'s how you\'re going to make the \nmoney.\n\nWhat I\'m talking about here is day trading.  \n\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \nhe makes money. \n\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \n\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \namounts of money at it.  It\'s not rocket science, and you \nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\n\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \n\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \nstrategies to make money.  \n\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\nring.  They don\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\ndon\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\nto execute a trade for which they\'d charge you forty or fifty \ndollars.\n\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\n\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \nperson.\n\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \nper trade.\n\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\'s society absolutely,\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\n\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\na few hours of studying.  \n\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\nthe stock market, I\'ve learned the following lessons:\n\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\n\n** Anyone can do it.\n\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\n\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\'t become\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\n\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\nsecret formula for day trading that I\'ve used profitably\nyear after year.\n\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \n\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \n\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \n\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\n\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\n\n\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\n\n\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \n\n\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \nmistakes beginners make.\n\n\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \nconsistently in every market! \n\n\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \nfor great success. \n\n\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\n\n\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\n\n\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\nreturns. \n\n\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \nprofessionals use.\n\n\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \n\n\nIt\'s time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the \nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?

'\n\nIt was the Spring of 1979.  \n\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\n\nStealing other kids\' lunch money.\n\nNo, I didn\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\nthem a little deal.  "Let me borrow two dollars today," I said,\n"and I\'ll bring you five dollars next week."  The investment\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \nwhen "next week" rolled around and I couldn\'t pony up the cash,\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \nlonger.\n\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \nthings on their mind than last year\'s lunch money.\n\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\nand I didn\'t even get beat up.\n\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \nsecrets you will ever learn.\n\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\'re not\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\nyou\'re ahead.  Don\'t wait for the boat to sink before \ngrabbing the lifejacket.\n\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\n\nThe "professionals", those stuffy investment counselors and\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\nyour money in the market, the more money you\'re going to make.\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\n"NEVER".  \n\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\nfund right now, you\'ll probably have over a million dollars\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\'s the problem:\n\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\n\nHell no!\n\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\'s hard to\nmake use of your fortune when you\'re seventy years old \nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \n\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\n\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\'t\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\'s how you\'re going to make the \nmoney.\n\nWhat I\'m talking about here is day trading.  \n\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \nhe makes money. \n\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \n\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \namounts of money at it.  It\'s not rocket science, and you \nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\n\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \n\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \nstrategies to make money.  \n\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\nring.  They don\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\ndon\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\nto execute a trade for which they\'d charge you forty or fifty \ndollars.\n\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\n\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \nperson.\n\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \nper trade.\n\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\'s society absolutely,\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\n\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\na few hours of studying.  \n\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\nthe stock market, I\'ve learned the following lessons:\n\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\n\n** Anyone can do it.\n\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\n\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\'t become\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\n\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\nsecret formula for day trading that I\'ve used profitably\nyear after year.\n\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \n\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \n\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \n\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\n\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\n\n\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\n\n\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \n\n\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \nmistakes beginners make.\n\n\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \nconsistently in every market! \n\n\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \nfor great success. \n\n\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\n\n\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\n\n\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\nreturns. \n\n\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \nprofessionals use.\n\n\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \n\n\nIt\'s time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the \nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"\n\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\n\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \ndollars.\n\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\nown financial future.\n\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \nmake money in the stock market.  \n\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren\'t laughing anymore.\n\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you\'re looking\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain\'t\nyour kind of game.\n\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise\nto teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a\nmillionaire through successful day trading.\n\nYou don\'t need to know anything about the market, and\nanyone can do it, with minimum effort.

You don\'t\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\'s how you\'re going to make the \nmoney.\n\nWhat I\'m talking about here is day trading.  \n\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \nhe makes money. \n\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \n\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \namounts of money at it.  It\'s not rocket science, and you \nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\n\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \n\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \nstrategies to make money.  \n\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\nring.  They don\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\ndon\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\nto execute a trade for which they\'d charge you forty or fifty \ndollars.\n\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\n\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \nperson.\n\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \nper trade.\n\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\'s society absolutely,\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\n\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\na few hours of studying.  \n\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\nthe stock market, I\'ve learned the following lessons:\n\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\n\n** Anyone can do it.\n\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\n\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\'t become\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\n\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\nsecret formula for day trading that I\'ve used profitably\nyear after year.\n\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \n\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \n\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \n\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\n\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\n\n\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\n\n\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \n\n\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \nmistakes beginners make.\n\n\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \nconsistently in every market! \n\n\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \nfor great success. \n\n\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\n\n\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\n\n\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\nreturns. \n\n\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \nprofessionals use.\n\n\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \n\n\nIt\'s time to ask yourself: "Am I going to listen to the \nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"\n\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\n\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \ndollars.\n\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \ntrading.

Oops, they weren\'t laughing anymore.\n\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\nis the fastest track to wealth.

L’équipe est aujourd’hui composée de 12 personnes. Inqual est soutenu par l’ANVAR et a été récompensé pour ses contributions à l’innovation par divers prix nationaux, dont le premier prix du concours Allègre.  Experte dans les architectures Internet, l’équipe d’Inqual  maîtrise les conceptualisations de haut niveau (UML) et les serveurs d’applications, notamment ZOPE. INQUAL construit une offre au service des collectivités locales en proposant le premier « SIIC » (Système d’Information Inter-Communal »). Ce système apporte une gamme complète d’outils permettant l’utilisation professionnelle de fonctionnalités Internet, Intranet et Extranet, sans connaissances informatiques. La première brique métier de ce « SIIC » est un outil d’automatisation de publication pluri-média du Bulletin d’Informations Municipales (BIM). Le logiciel LEBIM permet d’éditer et de modifier, \n en ligne et en temps réel l’information pratique de la collectivité locale. Des outils intégrés permettent de générer automatiquement le site Internet dynamique de la commune. Le site ainsi développé est mis à jour automatiquement et modifiable sans connaissances informatiques, par la commune elle-même.

I am sorry this mail\nWill surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara \nGot your contact through her private search.\nDue to the current war against white farmers in\nZimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to\nClaim all white owned farms in our country to gain\nFavor for re-election.\n\nAll white farmers were asked to\nSurrender their farms to the government for\nRe-distribution and infact to his political party\nMembers and my father though black was the treasury\nof the farmers association and a strong member of an\nOpposition party that did not support the president\nIdea. He then ordered his party members and the police\nUnder his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn\nDown everything in the farm. They killed my\nFather and took away a lot of items from his farm.\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a\nClose friend of my father handed us over will\nDocuments with instructions from my father that we\nShould leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will \nDocuments has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit\nKept in custody for us in a security company unknown\nTo the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as \nPersonal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could\nEasily be found by his enemies. The total amount is\nUS$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for\nYour assistance to help us move the fund out of\nZimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from\nreality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of\nInternational Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the \nFinance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer\nClearance above US$1M is just a few of the\nUnthinkable things he is committing in my Country.\nI have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.\nJohn Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was\nLeaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family\nLate last year following this ugly development to no\nAvail.\nShould you be interested to help us, contact me\nImmediately via email for easy communication and I\nWill furnish you with the time frame and modalities of\nthe transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of \nCaring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that \nThis transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will \nNot endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%\nOf the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any\nAccount of your choice were the incident of taxation\nwill not take much tool on the money and we look\nForward to coming over to your country to invest our\nShare and settle there. I will a private\nPhone so that our conversation can be\n100% confidential.\n\nPlease do not use the reply button, reply only to \n\nEdmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.\n\nGod bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.\n\nMr. EDWARD MULETE\n \n\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group Social Events: social@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/social for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

"\n\nDear ilug@linux.ie \n\nLife Partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies, allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later. We help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets. \nIndividuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health, financial and/or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates. We have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now. DO NOT drop your policy as it may be worth CASH to you NOW.\n\nWhy do people sell their policies? \nThe reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves. Some reasons may be to:\n\nPay off debts \nFund long term care insurance cost \nEliminate costly premiums \nTake advantage of other financial opportunities \nMake charitable contributions \nHelp family members \n \n  \nLife Partners ‘Living Solutions’ \n  \nTraditionally, life insurance provides benefits only after death. With Life Partners, it can provide cash benefits for LIFE! \n  \nLife Partners Objectives \nProvide market appraisal for life insurance policy owners \nProvide bids for qualified policies \nProvide lump sum cash payments to qualified owners \nEliminate costly premium payments  \n\nContact us now for a FREE appraisal of your life insurance policy.

"\n\n ilug ,\n\n From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,\n          Johannesburg,South Africa.\n\nMy Dear ,\n\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\n\nMy name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !\nconfiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\n\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!\n regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\n\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\n\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\n2.

You should know that this business is safety \nand 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or \nTerrorist fund.\n \nIf you are interested to carry out this transaction with \nme, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general \nexpenses, and 75% for us.\n\nYou are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full \nname and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement \nthat will guide and protect both of us in this transaction \nalso which will be used to effect the change of ownership \nof the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the \nconsignment.\n\nAlso send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy \ncommunication\n \nOnce you notify me your willingness by sending the above \nrequirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 \n(seven) working days.\n\nI will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on \nmy Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-\nmail: williamsfalana@caramail.com \n\nBest regards, \nBarrister Williams Falana {SAN} \n______________________________________________________\nBo=EEte aux lettres - Caramail - http://www.caramail.com\n\n\n--=_NextPart_Caramail_0054031032174770_ID--\n\n\n'

'\n\n \n\n                  Welcome to "Ghetto" America!\n…...Yes, you heard me; I said "Ghetto" America! What is "Ghetto" \nAmerica, I\'m glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, \nthis explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is \nno less true! "Ghetto" America is a society of individuals \ncomprised primarily of African Americans who represent the \nimpoverished, and often unpolished side of "Black America;" \nConfused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a \ntypical ghetto community; namely the "projects" and noticed an \nunusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular \nneighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have \nbeen to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young \n"teen looking" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby \ncarriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also \nnoticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying \nthem. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the \nabsence of the all important "wedding band" missing from their \nrespective ring fingers!" .And of course we have all heard \nstories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly \nmugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know \nthat many young African American women refuse to date African \nAmerican males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In \nfact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who \nrepresent the subversive side of society; commonly known as \n"Thugs" or "Street Hustlers;" Also, did you know that many young \nAfrican American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while \nliving in government housing better known as the "projects" \nrather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make \ninvestments?\n \n    "Attention" This is Not another "Boyz in the Hood" Story!\n \nThese newly distinguished "Black Generation Xers" are suffering \nthrough utter chaos. "Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare \nAbusers...Images of My America" is a collection of observations, \nand commentary as told through the eyes of a young African \nAmerican Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths \nthat many in "Black America," and the world in general would have \nyou believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds \nlight on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of \n"Mainstream American Society." A society that has nurtured the \nrampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many \nyoung African American men, and women currently suffer from. The \nwriter supports his arguments with direct references to the \noverwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to \nraise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish \ncriteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes \nbeing based on nothing more than the young black male\'s tough or \ncool neighborhood reputation.\n \nThe author also identifies the self-destructive and often \ncriminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily \nbasis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, \nrobbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing \nexpensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior \ncommitted by both males, and females is due in large part to a \nlack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless \nhomes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with \nthe unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in \nthe form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations \nare the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack \nof direction that currently exists in young "Black America" \ntoday.

"\n\n\n       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.\n       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\n        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\n        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\n        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\n        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\n        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\n        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \n        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\n         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \n         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\n         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.\n          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.\n          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered by List Builder\nTo unsubscribe follow the link:\nhttp://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4\n"
'\n\n\n                         Foreword\n\nAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in "Ghetto America," an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the "Black Generation X". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of "Generation X". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed "Baby Boomers", it\'s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled "Generation X", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: \n \n "We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the \'here and now\', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It\'s that simple. It seems we have come to be called "Xer\'s" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse."\n"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong." \n\nThis definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these "similarities" speak primarily to only "white" issues and concerns. For instance, "they" say "we" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America "we" could only depend on one …our mothers! "They" also say, " . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations," and " . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever." In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all "we" have time for. \nI have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer\'s black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the "Black" from "Generation X" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.\nThere are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. "White America" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs\'s documentary entitled "Ethnic Notions." When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching "Roger & Me," another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex\n posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.\nRegarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.\n Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It\'s funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female\'s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. \nWhat originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with "Huxtable?like" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn\'t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or "working class" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the "Huxtable?like" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. \nThe majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our "dirty laundry". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. \nI recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. \nThe purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that "black male and female generation X" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I\'m attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don\'t feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)\nRegarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.\nIn my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they\'ve got a million. It\'s a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. \nThinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one\'s self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don\'t have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our "male rapper" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. "The Big Tymers", a popular rap duo, have a song called "I\'m Still Fly", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. ("Fly" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female\'s beauty). Its signature verse asserts:\n\n"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci\nSuit, can\'t pay my rent cause all my money\'s\nspent, but that\'s O.K. cause I\'m still fly."\n\nWorse yet, in the song "Grinding", the popular duo "Eclipse" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term "grinding" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are "grinding…you know what I keep in the lining" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and\n\n"Patty cake Patty cake I\'m the bakers man\nI bake them cakes as fast as I can\nand you can tell cause of how my bread stack up\nand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup"\n\nIn this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term "cake" or sometimes "pie") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. \nThe negative references I\'ve identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al\n luded too. \nI have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of "us" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. \nAdditionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being "African?Americans", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as "Black", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as "Niggas," a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with "Nigger". The term "nigga" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term "My Nigga") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as "Ghetto", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the\n  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. \nMy commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.\nIn the case of the black female\'s negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman\'s fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by "White America". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno\n wledging that this absence is by design. \nThere are other "core" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn\'t sell drugs or was not "thugged out". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the "thug," and "drug dealer" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. \nThese issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that "confused mentality" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American "ghetto" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that "ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into "Black America".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that "backward thinking" is the main \n cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.\n*************************************************************\n To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.com\n\n\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\nwith "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message\n\n'

"\n\n\n       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.\n       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\n        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\n        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\n        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\n        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\n        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\n        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \n        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\n         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \n         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\n         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.\n          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.\n          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nPowered by List Builder\nTo unsubscribe follow the link:\nhttp://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5\n"

'\n\nMy name is Jeremy Lessaris. I\'m looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I\'ve been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I\'m looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they\'re really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don\'t sell.\n\nI need those houses...\n\nMost of the agents I\'ve dealt with were hesitant because there isn\'t much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use "unconventional" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) \n\nI\'m not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don\'t be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I\'ll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I\'m interested or not. \n\nIf you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com \n\nBest Wishes, \nJeremy Lessaris\n\n\n847.366.4300\nwww.synteligent.com\njeremy@synteligent.com\n\n\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\nwith "unsubscribe freebsd-ports" in the body of the message\n\n'

"\n\nFROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. \nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. \nTel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236\nemail : mikebundu@rediffmail.com\nDear Sir/Madam\n\n\nSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. \n\nPlease permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This\nis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a \ndependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange\nand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence \nand pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \nhis soul rest in peace. \n\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \n\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \nas the beneficiary. \nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \n\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\nthe information We gathered from an associate \nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \n\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\ninformation to enable us discuss the \nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\n\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \nus. \n\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\nThank you and God Bless. \nBest Regards \n\n\nCOL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com\n\nN\\B. When you are calling my line, you dial your country Intl. access\ncode, then you dial directly, do not include my country \ncode i.e. (243).

'\n\nHello\n\nYou may have seen this business before and\nignored it. I know I did - many times! However,\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\n\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\n\nI\'ll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\nto one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething just said: "You throw away $25.00 going to\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those "feelings"\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\ndoing had I not. Read on. It\'s true. Every word of it.\nIt is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying\nand selling something of value.\n\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:\n\nMaking over half a million dollars every 4 to 5\nmonths from your home.\n\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!\n==================================================\nBE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!\n\nBefore you say "Bull", please read the following.\nThis is the letter you have been hearing about on the\nnews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\nnot the program was legal.\n\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\n"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\nthe program and if people can \'follow the simple\ninstructions\' they are bound to make some mega bucks\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost".\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\nBETTER THAN EVER.\n\nThis is what one had to say: "Thanks to this\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in."\n\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n==================================================\nAnother said: "This program has been around for a\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple\nsteps and NOT change anything."\n\nMore testimonials later but first, =======\n\n==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every\n4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the\nfollowing...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!\n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND \nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP\nLEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\n\n===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===\n===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save\nthem on your computer and resell them.\nYOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.\n\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.\nSave them on your computer so they will be accessible\nfor you to send to the 1,000\'s of people who will\norder them from you. Also make a floppy of these\nreports and keep it on your desk in case something\nhappens to your computer.\n\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who\nare listed next to each report, or their sequence on\nthe list, in any way other than what is instructed\nbelow in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out\non the majority of your profits. Once you\nunderstand the way this works, you will also\nsee how it will not work if you change it. \n\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you\nalter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried\nto put their friends\'/relatives\' names on all five\nthinking they could get all the money. But it does\nnot work this way. Believe us, some have tried to\nbe greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not\ntry to change anything other than what is instructed.\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \n\nThis IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a\nproduct for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it\nas such and you will be VERY profitable in a short\nperiod of time.\n\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the\nperson in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through\nthe cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\n\n2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.\n\n3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.\n\n4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.\n\n5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2\n\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address\nACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.\n\n==================================================\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\n\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\nventure going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\'s also assume\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\'s\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders. That\'s 100 people who\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\n(half a million dollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\n==================================================\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\ne-mails each or more?\n\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\njust that, and more!\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\'s it.\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\nthe report.\n\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\nThe reason for the "cash" is not because this is\nillegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time.\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\nit before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\nname and postal address.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\n==================================================\n \nREPORT # 1: "The Insider\'s Guide To Advertising\nfor Free On The Net"\n\nOrder Report #: 1 from\nRui Sousa Santos\nP.O. Box 132\nTaylors Lakes VIC  3038\nAustralia\n ______________________________________________________\n\nREPORT # 2: "The Insider\'s Guide To Sending Bulk\nEmail On The Net"\n\nOrder Report # 2 from: \nRichard Moulton\nP.O.

Box 19\n52 Victoria Drive\nLondon SW19 6BD\nUnited Kingdom\n______________________________________________________\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for\nReport #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails\nuntil you do.\n\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks\nafter that you should receive 100 orders or more for\nREPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or\nsending e-mails until you do.\n\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\nin front of a different report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \nYou have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\n\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\nafter you have put your name and address in\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\nname will be on every one of them. \n\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\n\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\n"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\nreceiving \'junk mail\'. I made fun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I \'knew\' it wouldn\'t work.\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n\'I told you so\' on her when the thing didn\'t work. \n\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \'hobby\'."\n\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n================================================\n"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn\'t get enough orders to at least get\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \n\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\'t a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big."\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=================================================\n"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks."\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=================================================\n"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet."\n\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n=================================================\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\n\n=================================================\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \n\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\nof our technical ability.\n\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\nnever be used again.\n\nslaxflhxbkltlrolpefciayxx\n\n\n'

'\n\nHi,\n\nI\'m a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \nI\'m ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\n\nIn a minute I\'m going to tell you my secret,\nit\'s the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\n\nYou\'ve probably heard stories about people making\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\nboy-geniuses.\n\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\n\nIt\'s people like you and me that are making the real\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\n\nEver since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \ntechnique ever created - it\'s called BULK EMAIL.\n\nIf you\'ve ever recieved an email advertisement, then \nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can\'t click on \nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \nguarantee it.  Now let\'s go back to Math 101 and \nreview some numbers ...\n\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\nZERO!\n\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\n\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \nof work.  \n\nIt\'s that simple ...\n\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you\'re FILTHY RICH.\n\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn\'t \nmatter if you\'re a nineteen-year-old college student \nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \nexecutive working from an office building in New \nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\n\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \n"Dot Com" mania, and I\'ve never looked back.  I \nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \n\nYou don\'t need any money.  You don\'t need a product.\nYou don\'t need to be a computer nerd and no experience\nwhatsoever is required.  \n\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\nyou\'d jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\nSo what are you waiting for?!\n\nI\'m going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\n\nHere goes ...\n\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \ncomplete financial freedom?  \n\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \nthe 9-5 daily grind!\n\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\nis no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \nit.\n\nYou\'re probably wondering if it\'s hard to get started.  \nDon\'t worry, it\'s not! I will show you step-by-step \nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\nbuild a booming online business.  You\'ll be generating \norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.\n\nOkay, so what if you don\'t have anything to sell?\n\nNo problem!!  I\'ll show you where to find hot\nproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay\nstarting an Internet business because they have \nnothing to sell, but I\'m removing that hurdle right now.  \nAfter reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete \nproduct line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE \nnot to get started! I will get you up-and-running within \nseven days. In fact ...\n\nI personally guarantee that you will start your own \nbulk email campaign less than a week after reading \nthe Bulkbook!  I\'ll give you a toll-free phone number \nto reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; \nwhere else will you find that level of service?!\n\nI will also include a step-by-step guide to starting \nyour very first email campaign called "Seven Days to \nBulk Email Success".  This seperate guide contains a daily \nroutine for you to follow with specific, exact \ninstructions on how to get started.  On day one, for \nexample, I teach you where to find a product to sell. \nThe next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing \nlist.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your \nvery first campaign is ready to go.\n\nAs a special bonus, you\'ll recieve a FREE copy \nof our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk \nemail program which retails for $49.99! I\'ll even\ninclude 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE\nif you order NOW!\n\nStop wasting your money on auction listing fees, \nclassifieds, and banner ads - they don\'t work, and \nnever will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money \non the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  \nWhat are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing \nto share this knowledge, but I promise to teach \nyou everything I know about bulk emailing in this \nextraordinary bulk emailer\'s handbook ...

'\n\n================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============\n\nEvery once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it\'s going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it\'s hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I\'m writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. \n\n\nThe truth is, you\'ve got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you\'ve been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don\'t need to hear, I\'m just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with \'Send Link\' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn\'t a trick, I\'m just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don\'t want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you\'re one of those cautious people (and who isn\'t these days on the Internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we\'re all smiling!!\n\n\nPlease do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I\'m initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address\'s (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with \'remove\'. Thank you. \n\n\n'
