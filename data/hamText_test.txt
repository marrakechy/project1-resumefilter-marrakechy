"\n\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85507259\nDate: Not supplied\n\nThe Antikythera mechanism, recovered off a sunken ship in Greece in 1900, is \nthought to be a clockwork device to calculate the orbits of the celestial \nbodies. New analysis of the remaining fragments shows that it was wicked-cool: \n\n    The Greeks believed in an earth-centric universe and accounted for \n    celestial bodies' motions using elaborate models based on epicycles, in \n    which each body describes a circle (the epicycle) around a point that \n    itself moves in a circle around the earth. Mr Wright found evidence that \n    the Antikythera mechanism would have been able to reproduce the motions of \n    the sun and moon accurately, using an epicyclic model devised by \n    Hipparchus, and of the planets Mercury and Venus, using an epicyclic model \n    derived by Apollonius of Perga. (These models, which predate the mechanism, \n    were subsequently incorporated into the work of Claudius Ptolemy in the \n    second century AD.) \n\n    A device that just modelled the motions of the sun, moon, Mercury and Venus \n    does not make much sense. But if an upper layer of mechanism had been \n    built, and lost, these extra gears could have modelled the motions of the \n    three other planets known at the time—Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In other \n    words, the device may have been able to predict the positions of the known \n    celestial bodies for any given date with a respectable degree of accuracy, \n    using bronze pointers on a circular dial with the constellations of the \n    zodiac running round its edge.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Mark!_)\n\n[1] http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1337165\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/UKW9AAQCsFibH\n\n\n"

This \nweek, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda \nreally entails: \n\n    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another \n    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to \n    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that \n    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't \n    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants \n    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used \n    to violate copyrights. \n\n    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the \n    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask \n    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep \n    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing \n    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a \n    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after \n    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some \n    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. \n    Saying it doesn't make it so.  \n\nLink[2] Discuss[3]\n\n[1] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/4132447.htm\n[2] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4175607.htm\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/WDUVXyKf9qUj\n\n\n"

'\n\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221\nDate: Not supplied\n\nThe Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the \nEntertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists\' claims that \nthe labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day\'s \nfindings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: \n\n    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to \n    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, \n    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently \n    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the \n    initiative for artists\' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief \n    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA \n    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared \n    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but \n    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared \n    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the \n    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for "Hell Freezes \n    Over," which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no \n    more than a 10% "reserve" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had \n    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) \n    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they \n    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Paul!_)\n\n[1] http://www.musicdish.com/mag/?id=6675\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/jU9jRkFhUcp\n\n\n'

As soon as I\'m in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I \nreally think I\'m going to pick this up. \n\n    That\'s partly because it costs less than half as much as its current \n    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same \n    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively \n    high- speed "GPRS" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious \n    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice \n    time is another story -- more on that later.) \n\n    Another reason I like the Sidekick\'s prospects: It was designed for, and \n    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing \n    hybrids focus on "enterprise" customers -- the big businesses that are \n    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most \n    clearly don\'t at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their \n    own words, "Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to \n    34-year-old demographic." \n\nI am that demographic!

As \nseveral people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their \nmost recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used \nto be the #1 "mark"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an \nattempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and \nGoogle bombing[3]. \n\nSpecifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked \nsite, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the \nlinked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for "go to hell"\n[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for "talentless hack"[6] \nno longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were \npreviously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on \nwhether Google is actively penalizing such sites. \n\nUnfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have \ncaused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on \nmedium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far \nas page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work \nputting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive \nwith complaints and speculation: \n\n- New update, pagerank death?[8] \n- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \n- Let\'s find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] \n\n(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no \nlonger indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely \nfalse. Searching diveintomark.org for "gimli"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]\n, where "Gimli" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) \n\nRegardless, Google\'s search results in general appear to be significantly \ndegraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam \nsites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so \ngood at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing \nfrequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they\'re \ntracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It \ndidn\'t take long. \n\n- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a \nhotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems \nunhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and \nGoogle absolutely knows I\'m in the US based on my IP address). \n- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC \nnewspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet \nbetting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \n- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent \nsite, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself \n(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I \ndidn\'t care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn\'t \nthat helpful. \n\nMany people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com\n[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their \nresults for "eminem"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the \nbeginning of the end of Google\'s reign?\n\n\n\n[1]  http://www.google.com/search?q=mark\n[2]  http://www.pradnetwork.com/affiliate.htm\n[3]  http://uber.nu/2001/04/06/\n[4]  http://www.google.com/search?q=%22go+to+hell%22\n[5]  http://www.microsoft.com/\n[6]  http://www.google.com/search?q=talentless+hack\n[7]  http://www.ohmessylife.com/\n[8]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5646.htm\n[9]  http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5688.htm\n[10] http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/5723.htm\n[11] http://www.google.com/search?q=gimli+site%3Adiveintomark.org\n[12] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/29.html\n[13] http://www.google.com/search?q=reservation+hotel\n[14] http://www.venere.it/home/italy.html\n[15] http://www.venere.it/\n[16] http://www.google.com/search?q=news+observer+nc\n[17] http://www.news-observer.com/\n[18] http://www.linkslsgolfworld.com/king-arthur-knight-of-the-round-table.htm\n[19] http://www.nando.net/nt/nao/\n[20] http://www.google.com/search?q=eminem\n[21] http://www.alltheweb.com/\n[22] http://www.alltheweb.com/search?query=eminem\n\n\n'

Filmmakers \n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances \n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)\n\n[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/Adiw2xL5kw8ug\n[3] http://www.acme.com\n\n\n"

"\n\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nI've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 \nSetup program. \n\nFor various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, \nWindows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so \nI ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer \nthan I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup \nprocess should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the \nwizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already \nmade. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to \nchange where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and \neverything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the \nWindows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted \nare ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result \nis a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll \nwrite more about what I learned. \n\n  \n\nOne benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to \nhave someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper \nright hand corner.

'\n\nURL: http://boingboing.net/#85516085\nDate: Not supplied\n\nWe did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with \nTim O\'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV \nrecorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who\'s working on a book on \nfair use and copyfights. Glenn "802.11b Networking News" Fleishman took great \nnotes through the talk: \n\n    Dan: Tim, you\'re a "content or copyright holder…talk about these issues." \n\n    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. \n    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is \n    wrong: most aren\'t pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over \n    for years on shelves for three months, doesn\'t sell, that\'s it, and the \n    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. \n\n    Oblivion is fate of most books: "Piracy would be the best thing for those \n    books." People wouldn\'t pirate them in general, because people generally \n    like to respect the rights of creators. "Piracy is a marginal act; it takes \n    away some of the cream." \n\n    Publishing won\'t go away, but it will change the idea of who is a \n    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a \n    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often \n    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and \n    position in bookstores. \n\n    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will \n    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? \n\n    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media \n    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we\'re \n    stuck for a long time with "some mistakes."  \n\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Dan Gillmor\'s eJournal[3]_)\n\n[1] http://blog.glennf.com/gmblog/archives/00000254.htm\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/K3FKZ6jSJe2Px\n[3] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/\n\n\n'

"\n\nURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde\nDate: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00\n\nSo I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her \ncompany just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a \ntilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with \nremarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that \nreading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be \nhonest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind \nthat. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the \ntilde. \n\nEvery command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home \ndirectory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username \nwill take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to \ntheir Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can \ntrace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal \npages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to \nhave their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more \ncommonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html \nsubdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point \nyour browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files \nfrom that user's Sites directory within their home directory. \n\nBut I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. \n\nAs with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in \nthis field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (\nold habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene \nWallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a \ntilde. \n\nIn fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be \nused in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a \ntilde in its URL. \n\nClearly, the tilde is underappreciated. \n\nDigging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn \nthat the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd \ncharacter called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if \nindeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, \nto be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. \nThe tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; \n(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along \nthe line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky \nuses. \n\nDigging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for \n#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came \neven later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, \n1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee \nmeeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease \nSHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or \nwhat this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, \nwhen the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. \n\nAnd now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of \nyesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google \nGroups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William \nSafire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially \npronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary\n[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was \ncool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various \nASCII characters. \n\nAs early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem\n[11]. \n\nIn July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. \n\nIn February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that \nFidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. \n\nAs early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. \n\nAs early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. \n\nIn November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements \n(history,tilde,job control)[16]. \n\nAs early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed \nin the APL-11 character set[18]. \n\nIn April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying \nbugs in csh). \n\nIn December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting \nthis typographical pun[21]. \n\nAnd that's the earliest reference I can find. \n\nSo where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but \nthere are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the \ntilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for \n&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers \nto provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web \nsites?

But &#8220;because it'll future-proof \nyour site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. \nThe theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile \ndevices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. \nOops.\n\n\n\n[1] http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/css/\n[2] http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/003378.php\n[3] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/01.html#print_me\n[4] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/13.html#css_fun_and_games\n[5] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/14.html#moral_arguments_aside\n[6] http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/02/15.html#css_and_universal_design\n[7] http://diveintoaccessibility.org/\n\n\n"

When you \n    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, \n    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... \n\n    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? \n    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a \n    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an \n    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to \n    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as \n    disability and social security taxes.

As \nmany of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument \nfor the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. \n\nI\'m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would \nbe quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked \nme if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn\'t (and still \ncan\'t) think of anything I\'d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to \nLessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I\'m sort of embarassed to \nhave the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than \nme. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by \ncamping in line with us. \n\nSo, I\'ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an \nEldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth \nSchoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow.

Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, \nwhich, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time \naway from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a \ndrive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You\'d think it\'d be the last thing \nyou want to do. But it\'s not. When you\'re a Sim, you can tweak your existence a \nsmidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, \ntry the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing \nthemselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of \nthe Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O\'s at the \nsupermarket and asks where he can find the "Burns-O\'s." \n\n    "It\'s always a trip," Carr says.

We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince \nhim. After it was clear that wouldn\'t work, we threatened to bomb them and \nbegun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned \nto invade two months before the attacks. While it\'s not clear they knew about \n9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. \n\nThree days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline \nKarzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work \nfor the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline \nrather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable \nbecause it\'s too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. \n\nBin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn\'t \ncarry them out. It\'s far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, \ncarried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have \ngone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone \nafter Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect \nopportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize \nAfghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. \n\n"Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or \nright, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for \njustice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their \nfriends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of \ninfluential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took \nadvantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central \nAsia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will \ncause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it."\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html\n\n\n'

I am not \nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \nplease let me know.

I say \nhalf-hearted because I\'m still application-centric, and I don\'t go as far with \nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\'t use the desktop at all (never have, \non any system), and I don\'t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \n\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \ncommon programs. "0 Control Panel[3]", "1 Mozilla[4]", "2 Emacs[5]", "3 DOS \nhome", "4 DOS work", "5 DOS incoming" (each of which gives me a command line, \nbut in different directories), "7 Python[6]", "9 IE". Also "# Explorer home", \n"$ Explorer work", "% Explorer incoming", which open Explorer windows in \nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \nfirst letters as needed. "Ad-aware[7]", "Excel[8]", "IM", "Netscape 4[9]", \n"Paint Shop Pro", "Query Tool (ODBC)[10]", "VMWare[11]", "Word[12]". All other \nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \n"Accessories". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\'s probably a sign of a \nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \n\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\'m done using them \n(mostly because my laptop doesn\'t have a lot of memory). \n\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \nbash, which I don\'t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\'t let the system position the \nwindow. \n\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to "about:blank", set Internet Search to search \nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \n\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \nthat\'s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \n\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \nin a single directory (d:\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\'s bash shell \nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept "y" and "n" for \nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \n\nI don\'t use Windows\' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \nmy D drive I have d:\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \nprojects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the \nHOME environment variable), d:\\work (contains directories for each work \nproject, also under CVS), d:\\incoming (set as default download directory for \nall programs that download things), and d:\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \ncreated CVS projects). I don\'t know or care what\'s where on my C drive. \n\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\home\\phone. It is not in \nany particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank \nlines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses \nafter their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is \nmy single most backed-up possession. \n\nOther essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI\n[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].\n\n\n\n[1]  http://bitworking.org/Oct2002.html#X631695997519494480\n[2]  http://www.winterspeak.com/columns/082001.html\n[3]  http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article02-013\n[4]  http://www.mozilla.org/\n[5]  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html\n[6]  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/\n[7]  http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\n[8]  http://www.openoffice.org/\n[9]  http://sillydog.org/narchive/\n[10] http://gpoulose.home.att.net/\n[11] http://www.vmware.com/\n[12] http://www.openoffice.org/\n[13] http://www.cygwin.com/\n[14] http://diveintomark.org/mt/mt-search.cgi\n[15] http://www.ultraedit.com/downloads/index.html#notepad\n     Replacing Notepad with Ultraedit-32\n[16] http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp\n[17] http://www.cygwin.com/\n[18] http://www.guidescope.com/\n[19] http://download.com.com/3000-2092-10039884.html?part=zonealarm&subj=dlpage\n\n\n'

If they do, the decision could be a turning point \nin redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers — and the \ntechnology companies that are often in the middle." \n\nNewsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. "Larry Lessig admits it: he’s nervous. Who \nwouldn’t be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the \nseemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. \nBut it’s actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in \nthe age of the Internet." \'There’s a sense of deja vu to this. Television was \nsupposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industry’s \nsilver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that “the VCR is to the American \nfilm producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman \nhome alone.” (Video sales are now the studios’ biggest moneymaker.)

'\n\nURL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000647\nDate: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00\n\n=== Scissors === \n\nI, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike \neveryone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for \npermission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a \nbox of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket \nwas suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. \n\n    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my \n    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. \n\nShe put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They \ntook everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used \nthe opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked \nback up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying "This can\'t \ngo on board." "I don\'t remember packing that," I said. I let her confiscate it. \n\nI called my Mom. She doesn\'t remember packing it either. Is there some sort of \nterrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people\'s suitcases? I \ncan\'t see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I\'m on? Once \nI\'m on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but \nif they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the \nscissors? Perhaps it\'s some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their \nfists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky \nmouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, \nthey use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they \nuse the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever \nterrorists. \n\n*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was \nusing to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The \nnation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  \n\n=== Waiting for Wireless === \n\nNow I am at O\'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral\'s Club while \nbusinessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I \nused last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, \nI had an Admiral\'s Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite \nthe airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, \nyou know)--I doubt they will accept it. \n\n=== Irony === \n\nAccording to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his \nflight. \n\nI think of what I\'d say if I ran into him. "Jack!" I\'d exclaim, as if we were \nold pals. "Going to the Eldred case?" Of course he was. "Going to be a good \none." "Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?" I\'d ask. "You said \nyou were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the \nInternet. What ever happened to that?" I imagine him mumbling and looking down \nat his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. \n\nAnother announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing \nthese airline announcements keep me up to date. \n\n=== Automatic Flush Toilets === \n\nNow I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In \nthe first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little \nshort...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle \none mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three \ntimes. \n\nThis is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they \nexpect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied \nimmediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer\'s web \nsite. \n\n=== Arrival === \n\nI\'ve arrived in D.C.--once again, I\'m sitting a block away from my hotel on the \nsidewalk borrowing someone\'s connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with \nLisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now \nfor the meetings and parties. \n\nSorry for not responding to your email. I\'m rather busy. ;-)\n\n\n\n'

This entire article could be \nrewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. \n\nIf it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to \ndesign a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might \nlook something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: \n\n- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify \nrequired elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown \nnumber of parsers around the world. \n- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, \nthus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. \n- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such \negregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an \nobsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. \n- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core \nnamespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely \nresistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. \n- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its \nadd-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the \nspec would neither define nor elaborate on. \n- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements \nsemantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also \nfail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the \nsame thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers \nand inconsistent behavior across consumers. \n\nRSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. \nFor anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's \npretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication \nformat, we have the worst one possible. \n\nExcept, of course, for all the others. \n\nThe problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of \nnecessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format \nhas, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very \nweaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it \npossible in the first place. \n\n- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened \nup RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. \n- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing \ncontent and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce \nvalid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social \nmores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally \nintroducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable \ndisplay through unclosed HTML elements. \n- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't \nmatter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages \nwhere handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes \nand handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out \nin reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more \nflexibility. \n\nFurthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious \ncomputational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type \nDescription? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made \nit possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this \nease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts \nover the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the \nyear 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: \n\n- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which \nfell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. \n- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at \nthe time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years \nlater, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with \nparsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF \nparsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version \nis generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) \nMeanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts \nrecommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to \nactually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise \nof better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 \nfeed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the \nworld&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets \ninto a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. \n- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been \nhaphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be \nflourishing. \n\nEvolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a \nthousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to \ntheir eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. \n\n- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. \nMy RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a \nTEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know \nnothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is \nlittered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. \nIf everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would \nbe trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such \nperfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. \nThere is no middle ground. \n- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to \nearlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, \nthey are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long \ndescriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such \npractices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle \nthem. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it \nfaces. \n- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie \nOrgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list \nof RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with \nany evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS \n0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it \n&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is \nmissing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central \ngroup can design a better system in the long haul. \n\nDesigned formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable \nformats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect \nsyndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. \nInfrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, \npartially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html\n[2] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/syndication/message/467\n\n\n"

'\n\nURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html\nDate: Not supplied\n\nFeedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. \n\n*"Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information \nfrom the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end."* There are a \ncouple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in \none batch at the end, there\'s always a possibility that some step in the middle \nof the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will \nback out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error \nmessages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can \nfail is not insignificant. \n\nSecond, it\'s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages \nafter they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we \nprompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: \n\n[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup \nScreenshot)] \n\nThe account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be \npredicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might \nnot conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of \nWindows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha \ndidn\'t know that!). It\'s better to tell the user about this problem right away \nso they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the \nlong install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if \nyou force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part \nof the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you\'ve left \ntheir system in an indeterminate state. \n\nIn any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account \nin case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of \nthe wizard where I can display a useful error message. \n\nAnd what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to \nupgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a \nreboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been \nkeeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft\'s web server). So \npart one of the batch is "Stop IIS." Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it \nwould be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it\'s not like I \ndon\'t need to write the code for "Start IIS" for the end of the batch. So the \ncode to rollback "Stop IIS" is already written. No big deal, I just need to \ncall it at the right place. \n\nI think one reason that people think you should "gather all the info and then \ndo all the work" is because with very large installation programs that are very \nslow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user\'s time. Indeed even \nFogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the "create account" \noperation is so fast, that principle simply doesn\'t apply here. Even our 95% of \nthe work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for \nIIS to stop and start. \n\n*"Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself \nhas admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive."* First of all, leave \nyour language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed \nto figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious \narguments are unbelievably boring.  \n\nSecondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, \nsince I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And \nI don\'t know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really \nwell_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would \ndefinitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), \ncertainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do \nin this setup program are things like "grant the Logon as Service privilege to \nan account." This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this \nis to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you \nsearch the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you \nfind is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I \nknow, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated \nDelphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that \ncosts as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more \nproductive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the \ncode I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library \nI\'ve been using for years to make wizards. \n\n*"Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers\' money. Good Setup \nprograms don\'t increase sales."* This was actually the smartest question and \nmade me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: \n\n- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the \nlife of the code. \n- Delight my customers. When I\'m trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want \nthem to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won\'t hesitate \nbecause they are afraid to upgrade. I\'m still using an old version of \nSpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the \nnew version is much better, because I just can\'t bear the thought of another \nmorning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all \nthe little SSH windows, some su\'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and \nGoogle Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it \nsuspend, trying to guess why we can\'t get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it\'s \ntoo much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have \nlost my business because they don\'t have a SETUP program. \n- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of \nstandardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and \noranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a \nmeaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, \nmainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing \nsoftware. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is \nguaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it \nand say "Aha!"\n\n\n*"How can we make WISE[4] better?" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE \nInstallation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the \nreasons his product wasn\'t adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.\n\n[1] http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021002.html\n[2] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\n[3] http://discuss.fogcreek.com/delphiquestions\n[4] http://www.wise.com\n\n\n'

I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that \nthe run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short \nloop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 \nbug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds \nthem, can you please let me know? Thank you. \n\nI ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my \noff-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of \nrunners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner \nsmiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another \nrunner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative \nyears. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a \nrunner. \n\nBecoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves \nrunning. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important \npart. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, \nrun around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day \nyou'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can \nrun a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, \nthen get invigorated and run another mile. \n\nAnd then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and \nyou run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and \nthat the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running \nthing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and \nyou run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is \nimportant too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and \nrun. \n\nThere's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a \nrunner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you \nshould really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to \nmaximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't \nworry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just \nanother fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.\n\n\n\n"
