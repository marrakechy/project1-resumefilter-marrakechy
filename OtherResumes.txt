the business rules for the new application.
Design the story board using HTML and CSS and design database for applications by analyzing the customer requirements.
Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding
standards of the overall application.
Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS:
Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio
2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,
CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)
LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is
also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project
was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding
additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on
certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.
UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee
id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will
decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception
records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)
Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of
seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can
access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the
main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL
Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two
parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The
existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and
approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to
capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to
validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a
web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an
ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk
data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data
that can be uploaded into each column. AWARDS AND PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION:

I was hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3 accreditation packages each leading to
successful Authorization To Operate decisions. 
Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3
successful ATOs. 
Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. 
Succeeded in writing and implementing
vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. 
Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design
decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand
the best fit for the program. 
The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different

Requirements were fulfilled thru i
 dentifying product
problems and strengths and collected data on customer experienceÂ 
 and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.Â  The next challengeÂ  came as storage requirements for better performance and
more controlled uses. 
After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local
storage to over 200TB. 
In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the
alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,
purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.Â  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30
minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.
